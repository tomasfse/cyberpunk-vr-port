// CyberpunkVRPort -- drag the scanner's HUD where you want it, because HUDitor cannot.
//
// HUDITOR HAS NO SCANNER. Its movable set is a fixed list of named HUD controllers -- minimap, quest
// tracker, health, stamina, dpad, hotkeys, phone, weapon roster, crouch indicator, boss bar, dialog,
// compass, fps counter, the car HUD family -- and not one of them is the scanner. The only thing it
// does with the scanner is listen for its own ScannerDetailsAppearedEvent so it can slide the MINIMAP
// and the TRACKER out of the scanner's way. There was no setting to find: the feature is absent
// there, and this is it.
//
// WHAT IS MOVABLE, enumerated from the game's own scanner folder:
//
//   0  scannerGameController                            the frame and the scan progress
//   1  scannerDetailsGameController                     the details panel: name, level, tabs, chunks
//   2  QuickhacksListGameController                     the quickhack panel as a whole
//   3  ScannerHintInkGameController                     the hint line
//   4  QuickhacksListGameController.m_memoryWidget      the cyberdeck's memory
//   5  QuickhacksListGameController.m_listWidget        the script list
//   6  scannerDetailsGameController.m_changeTabButtonHints   the scanner's key hints
//
// The last three are CHILDREN of pieces 1 and 2 -- the memory, the scripts and the key hints all
// sat inside one movable block, which is what made them impossible to separate. Their offsets
// compose with the parent's: move the panel and they follow, then nudge one of them on top.
//
// scannerBorderGameController is deliberately absent: it is an inkProjectedHUDGameController, drawn
// projected onto the scanned object out in the world, so moving it would only tear the outline off
// the thing it outlines. The ~15 BaseChunkGameController subclasses (name, level, vulnerabilities,
// abilities, resistances, description, requirements, quest clues, vehicle info, quickhack
// description, twintone) are absent for the opposite reason -- they are children of the details
// panel, so slot 1 already carries them.
//
// NO CODEWARE AND NO REPARENTING, and both of those are measured rather than chosen. HUDitor reaches
// the HUD through GameInstance.GetInkSystem() and walks widgets with GetParentWidget(); the compiler
// rejects BOTH as unknown to the game ("method 'GetInkSystem' not found on 'GameInstance'", "method
// 'GetParent' not found on 'inkWidget'") -- they are Codeware's, registered at runtime. Everything
// used below was put to the compiler one call per function and came back resolved. Without a parent
// there is no way to hang a container beside a HUD root, so the transform goes on the root itself,
// which also means this mod never restructures the game's widget tree: the inkWidgetRef paths every
// scanner controller resolves internally stay exactly as the game built them.
//
// THE FOUR ROOTS MEET THROUGH THE PLAYER. Each controller writes its own root into a field added to
// PlayerPuppet as it initialises, because redscript has no global and, with no ink system to
// enumerate, one controller cannot otherwise see another's widget. The editor lives on the details
// panel and reads the four handles back from there.
//
// THE CONTROLS, while the scanner is up:
//
//   RIGHT SHIFT, tapped     enter the editor / step to the next piece (the others dim to 15%)
//   RIGHT SHIFT, held 0.4s  leave the editor and SAVE
//   mouse                   drag the selected piece -- no button to hold
//   W A S D                 nudge it one pixel
//   mouse wheel             scale it about its own middle, 0.1 .. 5.0
//
// THE MOUSE AND THE WHEEL ARE THE PORT'S OWN ACTIONS, declared in r6/input/, and that is not
// tidiness. Borrowing the game's UI_MoveUp / UI_MoveDown for the wheel also borrowed IK_W and IK_S,
// which the game binds to them as secondary UI navigation -- so W and S SCALED the piece while they
// were meant to nudge it. Before that, 'mouse_wheel' turned out to exist only in the UIShared
// context, which gameplay never enters, so the wheel did nothing at all.
//
// THE DRAG IS RAW MOUSE DELTA, not a cursor, and it needs no mouse button: 'click' is an action only
// in the PhotoMode, device, menu and popup contexts, so in gameplay a gate on it can never open --
// which is precisely why the mouse appeared to do nothing while W A S D worked. CameraMouseX and
// CameraMouseY do arrive here (context CameraMovement) and are consumed, so the view cannot turn
// while a piece is being dragged. There is no cursor to show either: HUDitor draws its own inkImage
// and even that one is decorative, since its drag is delta-based too. What tells you where you are
// is the dimming and the piece's name on screen.
//
// THE WHEEL ARRIVES UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME. 'mouse_wheel' belongs to the UIShared context and never
// fires in gameplay, so scaling was dead for the same reason the mouse was; UI_MoveUp / UI_MoveDown
// are the same notch seen from UI_QuickHackPanel, and the quickhack panel is muted while the editor
// is up, so nothing else takes them.
//
// Only while scanning: the Right Shift listener is registered when a scanned object appears and
// dropped when it goes, so the key does nothing at all the rest of the time.
//
// WHERE THE NUMBERS LIVE: the plugin, in bin/x64/vrport.ini as xr_scanner_frame / _details /
// _hacks / _hint, three values each (x, y, scale). A redscript cannot write a file, so the editor
// writes through VRScannerSlotSet and asks for ONE ini save when it closes -- not per drag frame,
// which would be hundreds of writes for one gesture.
//
// NO `module` LINE HERE: a native declared inside a module is looked up by its module-qualified name
// while the plugin registers plain globals. That mistake cost a startup once already.

// Queued to the player and handled on the details controller, which is how the quickhack panel does
// its own delayed work (DelayedDescriptionIntro). It exists because the panel's intro animations and
// its rebuilt memory cells land AFTER the hook that first applies our transform, so the layout has to
// be put back once the game has finished moving things about.
