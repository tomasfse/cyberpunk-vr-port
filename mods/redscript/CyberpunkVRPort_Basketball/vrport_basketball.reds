// CyberpunkVRPort -- VR basketball. Physics half.
//
// The ball entity is vrbasketball\vr_basketball.ent from vrport_basketball.archive: one
// entPhysicalMeshComponent over a mesh whose rigid body was re-authored to real ball values
// (0.624 kg, shell inertia 2/3*m*r^2, damping 0.02, r = 0.1191 m, World Dynamic filter).
//
// What the engine CANNOT give us is bounce. Every one of the 83 materials in
// base\physics\physicsmaterials.physmatlib has restitution 0.2 or 0.05 -- rubber.physmat is 0.2 --
// and PhysX combines a contact pair's restitution (default eAVERAGE), so no per-material edit can
// reach a basketball's e ~= 0.85 without making the whole city bouncy. Instead the normal
// component is topped up here, once per contact, against an ENERGY target rather than a
// delta-v -- aiming at a delta-v always undershot, because by the time the correction lands the
// ball has both slowed and risen:
//
//     budget = (e_target*v_in)^2 / 2  -  g_n * s     s = travel along the normal since contact
//     J      = m * (sqrt(2*budget) - v_n)
//
// The tangential half is left entirely to PhysX: with the corrected shell inertia its
// slide->roll transition and spin are already right, which is where backspin comes from.
//
// e(v) is not a taste knob. Rubber is viscoelastic, so restitution falls with impact speed;
// the NBA rule (drop 1.80 m, rebound 1.20-1.40 m) pins e = 0.82..0.88 at v = 5.94 m/s.
//
// NOTE: intentionally NO `module` statement -- same reason as vrport_smoking.reds: the plugin
// registers its natives at global scope and a module would make redscript look them up qualified.
