-- Arasaka Tamayura — physical-reload configuration.
--
-- Measured from two recordings of the game's own reload with VRIK off (reload_record_EMPTY_TAMAYURA and
-- reload_record_NOTEMPTYTAMAYURA, 241 and 253 frames, every column present). Where a number could not be measured
-- it says so and says where it came from instead -- there is nothing here that was chosen by eye.
--
-- WHAT THIS PISTOL IS. It ships its own meshes but borrows the Tsunami Nue's animations and rig, and it has no .app
-- of its own: it is assembled by two appearances INSIDE the Nue's file, `tamayura_default` and `tamayura_2077`. The
-- collision host, the vrp_ slots and the case effect went into those two only; the Nue's own eight are untouched.
--
-- ITS RIG IS THE UNITY'S, bone for bone: 11 frame bones with the same names at the same indices (slide 5, hammer 6,
-- mag_slot 8) and the shared 5-bone magazine rig. So one signature covers both weapons, and -- measured -- the slide
-- bone even rests and locks at the same two places (85.9 / 45.9 mm on local Z).
--
-- WHAT THE ANIMATION DOES AND DOES NOT DO, straight off the two takes:
--   * a NORMAL reload never touches the slide: the bone reads 85.9 mm on all 253 frames.
--   * an EMPTY one does not RACK it either -- it presses the slide-release BUTTON. The left hand comes in from
--     0.160 to 0.129 m of the slide slot with its thumb reaching 42.5 mm, and on the very next frame the slide runs
--     home: 45.9 -> 56.6 -> 74.2 -> 85.1 -> 85.9 in four frames, peak 0.80 m/s.
--   * that press is a two-handed hold, so there is no free-hand gesture in it to reuse -- the port's own slide
--     release is the right stick click (vrshared::kRightStickClick), and racking by hand is the module's doing.
