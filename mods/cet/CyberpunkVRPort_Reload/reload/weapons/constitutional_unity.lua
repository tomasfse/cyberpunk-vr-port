-- Constitutional Arms Unity — physical-reload configuration.
--
-- Everything here is measured, and every number says where it came from. Two recordings of the game's own
-- empty_reload with VRIK off (reload_record_PALM / reload_record_FINGERSBACK, 248 and 256 frames) were read by
-- tools/analyze_reload_record.py -- the same reader reproduces the Silverhand's shipped grips to 0.1 mm on the
-- barrel axis, which is how the basis convention is known to match what reload.lua rebuilds at runtime.
--
-- HOW THIS PISTOL DIFFERS FROM THE SILVERHAND, all of it read off the data rather than assumed:
--   * ONE slide bone (`slide`, frame rig bone 5) where the Silverhand has front_slider + back_slider.
--   * NO round in the rig at all. Its 11 frame bones are barrel_plug, barrel, muzzle_slot, fx_muzzle,
--     weapon_trigger, slide, hammer, slider_down, mag_slot, scope_slot, pos_ironsight -- not a bullet among them.
--     The case is thrown by the game's own EFFECT instead; see `ejectFx`.
--   * NO rotator disc, so no flourish.
--   * Its empty reload does not RACK the slide: the slide is already locked back, the hand pulls it a couple of
--     millimetres to trip the catch and it springs home on its own (measured, both takes agree frame for frame:
--     42.5 mm at rest on the catch, 44.5 at the pull, then 41.2 -> 27.4 -> 10.6 -> 0.0 in four frames).
--     In VR the player may still rack it by hand whenever he likes -- that is the module's doing, not the anim's.
