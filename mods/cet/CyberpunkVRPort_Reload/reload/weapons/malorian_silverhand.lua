-- Every value here is grounded in data, not guessed:
--   * bone indices are the weapon's OWN rig bone indices (the plugin's VRRigWrite maps them to the shared
--     pose-buffer slot through the live remap; see memory weapon-rig-identification).
--   * which parts move, along which sense, and how far come from decoding the game's own reload animations
--     (memory reload-animation-mechanics): the magazine drops, a new one comes in, a round chambers, and the
--     slide + hammer move ONLY on empty_reload. Physically we let the player do any of it any time.
--
-- `match` is tested as a lowercase substring of the weapon's appearance / mesh name.
