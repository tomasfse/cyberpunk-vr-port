-- Malorian Overture — physical-reload configuration.
--
-- The thirteenth weapon and the FIRST REVOLVER, which makes it the first whose reload has no slide, no magazine
-- well and no part that slides at all. Everything on it turns:
--
--   * `magazine_open` (4) is the CRANE. It swings the cylinder 100 deg clear of the frame -- measured in both takes,
--     and in both it stays out for exactly 1.60 s before the game shuts it.
--   * `cylinder` (8) is the crane's CHILD and spins about its own axis. 57.7 deg is one chamber of six and 177.7 is
--     three. It turns in the ORDINARY reload and not at all in the empty one, which is the gun's own logic: with
--     every chamber spent there is nothing to index round.
--   * `mag_slot` (9) is a child of the CYLINDER, so the seat rides both -- crane and spin. Nothing has to be done
--     about that: read the slot and it is already where the cylinder put it.
--   * `hammer` (3) cocks 37.5 deg.
--
-- AND ITS "MAGAZINE" IS A SPEEDLOADER: eleven bones, six of them `bullet_01..06` on a 13.4 mm circle -- the six
-- chambers -- and twelve meshes, a shell and a tip per round. The spawned entity mirrors all twelve, which it can
-- because every shell's mesh already carries its own chamber (its `boneRigMatrices[0].W` is exactly minus its
-- bullet bone's position in the rig).
