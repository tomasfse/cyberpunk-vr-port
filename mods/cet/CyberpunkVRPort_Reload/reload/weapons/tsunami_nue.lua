-- Tsunami Nue — physical-reload configuration.
--
-- The cheapest weapon in the set so far, and honestly so: it shares its rig, its animations and its sound bank with
-- the Arasaka Tamayura (which is assembled from two appearances inside this weapon's own .app), so everything the
-- ANIMATION determines is already measured and carries over exactly. What does NOT carry over is anything the MESH
-- determines, and there is one of those -- see holdOffset.
--
-- Its own assets: the frame mesh (collision baked from its shadow: barrel 18 541, slide 13 065, slider_down 1 740
-- bytes, each mapped to its own bone and Kinematic) and the magazine mesh, which is its own rather than borrowed.

        -- measured { 0.10044, 0.02180, -0.03683 }. But we place a spawned ENTITY there, and an entity is placed by
        -- its ORIGIN -- which is a property of the mesh, not of the animation. Measured off the two meshes'
        -- bounding boxes: the Tamayura's magazine runs Z -124.9..+5.9 mm, i.e. its origin sits on the TOP face (the
        -- end that enters the well, which is also where the mount is -- that coincidence is why placing the entity
        -- at the mount reads correctly on the other two pistols). This one runs -65.6..+65.6: its origin is in the
        -- MIDDLE of the body. Placed unchanged, half the magazine would sit inside the hand.
        --
        -- So the placement is corrected by the difference between the two top faces, 59.7 mm, taken along the
        -- magazine's own long axis (local Z on both) and rotated into the hold slot's frame by holdRotBasis:
        -- (0, 0, -0.05970) -> (-0.05897, -0.00931, -0.00067), on top of this weapon's OWN measured mount offset
        -- { 0.10042, 0.02180, -0.03684 } (its takes agree with the Tamayura's to 0.02 mm -- the animation is shared).
        --
        -- THE SIGN IS SETTLED BY OBSERVATION, both directions tried in VR. With the correction as below the magazine
        -- sits slightly INTO the fingers -- a small residual. Flipped, it hung about 12 cm above the hand, which is
        -- twice the 59.7 mm correction: the signature of a wrong sign rather than a wrong size. So the direction here
        -- is right and what is left is a centimetre or two, which the overlay tuner is for -- print the result and
        -- bake it into this line rather than leaving it on a slider.
        -- THE PURE MEASUREMENT, with nothing added: where the game's own hand holds the magazine relative to the
        -- mount, from this weapon's takes (they agree with the Tamayura's to 0.02 mm -- the animation is shared).
