-- Arasaka Kenshin — physical-reload configuration.
--
-- The first weapon in this set that is genuinely a different machine, and every difference is measured:
--
--   * ITS RIG IS 10 BONES, not the 11 the other four share. There is no `slider_down`, so `mag_slot` sits at index
--     7 instead of 8 -- the old signature would not have recognised it and the recording would have come back with
--     zeroed rig bones. Registered in reload/rigs.lua before the first take was made.
--   * IT HAS NO SLIDE STOP. Read off its own rig animation (w_handgun__arasaka_kenshin__base1.anims.glb), every
--     clip returns the handle home and none holds it back: empty_reload 98.6 -> 44.7 mm, recoil_shoulder -> 47.5,
--     safe_action -> 69.4, first_equip -> 32.0. So there is no `lockLocal` here, and the whole slide-stop machinery
--     stays switched off for this pistol.
--   * TWO PARTS MOVE, not one. `slide` is the REAR charging handle the hand pinches; `hammer` -- despite the name --
--     is the long part that rides over the top (its geometry runs 193 mm along the weapon, which no hammer does).
--     In empty_reload the handle travels 53.9 mm while that part travels 70.0, and it leads the handle by a frame or
--     two. That is a rider, exactly like the Silverhand's front slider.
--   * NO CASE. A tech pistol: its effect spawner has no `ejection_port` at all -- what it has is `charging`,
--     `charged`, `discharge` and a `reload`. So nothing is ejected and no `ejectFx` is set.
--   * ROUNDS COME FROM THE HANDLE, not from the magazine. With no stop there is nothing to hold the rounds back
--     against, so `chamberOnRack` does it explicitly: seating a magazine spends the reserve but loads nothing, and
--     the rounds go in when the handle has been worked. The user's own rule for this weapon.

        -- orientation is not recoverable, which was tried and rejected here by its own self-check (the composition
