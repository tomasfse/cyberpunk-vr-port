-- Constitutional Arms Liberty — physical-reload configuration.
--
-- Measured from three recordings of its own reload with VRIK off: LIBERTYEMPTY_PALM (248 frames),
-- LIBERTYEMPTY_BACKFINGERS (213) and LIBERTYNOTEMPTY. Unlike the Tamayura and the Nue this pistol has its OWN rig
-- and its own animations, so nothing here is carried over except the magazine's hand poses -- and those are exact
-- rather than transferred, because the Unity uses THIS weapon's magazine mesh.
--
-- WHERE THE PATCH HAD TO GO, and it cost a round of empty recordings to find out: the Liberty has no root .app under
-- its own name. Its item record says `appearanceResourceName = Preset_Liberty_Rogue`, so the live entity is built
-- from `w_handgun__constitutional_liberty__rogue.app` -- which despite the filename holds ALL ELEVEN appearances
-- (default, yorinobu, dex, military1/2, neon1/2, pimp1/2, padre, rogue). Patching only the part package
-- `appearances\w_handgun__constitutional_liberty__base1_01.app` left the live mesh component a plain
-- entSkinnedMeshComponent and not one vrp_ slot resolved. Both files carry the host, the slots and the case
-- descriptor now.
--
-- ITS RIG IS THE SAME 11 BONES as the Unity's, Tamayura's and Nue's, with the same names at the same indices AND the
-- same bind pose: the slide bone rests at 85.9 mm and locks at 45.9, exactly as on the other three.
--
-- WHAT ITS ANIMATION DOES: it does not rack the slide either. The hand lifts it about 4.7 mm off the catch (45.9 ->
-- 50.6, held for five frames) and the slide runs home on its own: 52.4 -> 66.9 -> 81.6 -> 85.9, peak 0.67 m/s. Only
-- three or four frames of the whole take have the slide in motion.
