-- Militech Lexington — physical-reload configuration.
--
-- The seventh pistol, and the one that broke the most assumptions in the set:
--
--   * ITS FRAME RIG HAS 11 BONES, exactly like the Constitutional Unity's family, and is not that family at all --
--     different names in a different order, with no bone called `slide` anywhere. Its moving parts are `barrel_back`
--     (bone 3, the slide the hand racks: 108 mm of geometry) and `barrel_top` (bone 4, a small piece riding on top).
--     Registering it uncovered a real bug in the plugin: the signature table was keyed on (rig, bone count) alone, so
--     this weapon would have silently un-registered the four pistols that share its count. Fixed there.
--   * ITS MAGAZINE RIG IS THE SHARED ONE, base\weapons\firearms\handgun\rig\w_handgun__mag_std.rig, not one of its
--     own. Five bones as usual but in a different order: `magazine` is 2, mag_stdr 3, mag_std 4.
--   * THREE appearance packages carry the patch: the root, `__silenced`, and the part package -- 17 + 2 + 17
--     appearances between them.
--   * NO HAND EVER TOUCHES ITS SLIDE IN A RELOAD. Measured across all four takes: the left wrist never comes within
--     107 mm of the slide slot, and the slide simply runs off its catch. The pinch below therefore comes from
--     `first_equip`, which is the one animation in which a hand does rack it (the user's own reading, confirmed).

        -- THE WRIST IS TRANSFERRED, not measured, and that is stated plainly because it is the one number here that no
        -- measurement of this weapon could give: a wrist cannot be read out of the animation files (the arm rig's
        -- WeaponRight frame relates to the runtime hand by an unknown mount rotation -- 36 cm of residual when it was

        -- joint angle, the fourth is 32.8-34.1 deg away from all three (72.5 deg at the middle fingertip), which is a
        -- different hold and not noise. The game has three reload variants, so this is the animation's own doing.
        -- At the PUSH the same comparison gives 0.9-19.9 deg with no clustering at all, so the insertion is one
        -- ladder for both carries.
        --
        -- Depths follow the hand: measured, the fingers open between 114 and 87 mm out and stay open to the seat.
        -- AND THE TWO CARRIES PLACE THE MAGAZINE DIFFERENTLY, which is the point of having two: one holds it in a
        -- fist, the other flat on the palm, and a magazine cannot sit the same way in both. Each was set in the
        -- overlay tuner and printed from the game, and the log says which pose was on the hand at each print, so
        -- there is no guessing about which correction belongs to which:
        --     `carry`   (fist) += { -0.125, +0.093, +0.058 } m and -79.67 / -24.45 / -32.52 deg -> 166 mm and 81 deg
        --                        from the seated relation
        --     `carry_b` (palm) += {  0.000, +0.042,  0.000 } m, no rotation at all -> 42 mm and 0.4 deg
        -- The finger corrections from the same two prints are baked into the pose files themselves.
        --
        -- A HOLD DOES NOT CHANGE ON THE WAY IN. Each variant keeps ITS OWN placement through every stage, and only
        -- the fingers roll. The first cut rolled the placement towards the seated relation as the magazine went in,
        -- the way the Kenshin's hand slides down its magazine -- and on this pistol that reads as the magazine
        -- sliding backwards through the hand as you insert it ("съезжает магазин по ладони обратно на эти 42").
        -- The difference is what was tuned: on the Kenshin the roll IS the motion, here the two holds were set by eye
        -- as finished holds, and a hold that was judged right should not be walked away from.
        --
        -- Which is also why every stage carries off2/rot2: without them the palm variant would fall back to the
        -- fist's placement from the third stage on, which is the same jump by another route.
        --
        -- THE TWO VARIANTS DIFFER IN WHETHER THE HAND RE-GRIPS, and that is the whole of it:
        --
        --   * THE FIST slides down the magazine as it goes in, the Kenshin's motion exactly: the placement rolls from
        --     the fist to the hand's PALM-ON-THE-BASE relation while the fingers open, so the palm arrives under the
        --     base at the same moment the magazine does. 96 mm of slide along the magazine, which is what the game's
        --     own hand does.
        --
        --     WHERE the roll ends was measured, then moved by hand at the user's call. Tracking the distance from
        --     the hold slot to the magazine's BASE through the whole push: 63-67 mm while it is carried, a minimum of
        --     43 mm at 78-88 mm of depth, 67-72 mm by the seat. So the game's own hand is on the base BEFORE the
        --     magazine is home and has left it again by the time it is, and ending the roll on the seating window
        --     left the hand a wrist's width behind the base ("досылает кистью где уже предплечье").
        --
        --     First it was moved 24.3 mm STRAIGHT AT the base -- not along the magazine, which was tried and does
        --     nothing: sliding along its length takes 67.4 mm only down to 67.1, because the gap is sideways rather
        --     than lengthways. Then the user placed it by eye from inside the headset: another 30 mm to the LEFT and
        --     30 mm back towards himself, read along the barrel. That is said about the WEAPON, so it is converted
        --     into the hold slot's frame by the weapon-to-slot rotation measured over the seating window -- and then
        --     SUBTRACTED, which is the half that went wrong first time round and shipped the hand 3 cm the other way:
        --     `off` is the magazine's position relative to the HAND, so moving the hand by d moves that number by -d.
        --     The 24.3 mm step above had the sign right; this one added instead of subtracting.
