-- The twelfth pistol and the first out of Phantom Liberty, so everything of its own lives under `ep1\`.
--
--   * ELEVEN bones, the third rig in the set with that count and unlike either of the others (the Unity family and
--     the Lexington). TWO large moving parts: `middle_slider` (3), the front shroud, and `end_slider` (5), the whole
--     upper -- and `muzzle_slot` and `fx_muzzle` are CHILDREN of the front one, so on this weapon the muzzle moves.
--   * Its magazine rig is the first with SIX bones -- an extra `bullet_rotator` -- which makes it unambiguous on
--     count alone. Its bind rotations are 92 and 132 deg where every other magazine in the set carries 180, so the
--     bone-versus-mesh turn was derived from the mesh matrix rather than taken from the others (it came out at the
--     familiar 180 all the same -- the BINDS differ, the mesh matrix does not).
--   * No `ejection_port` effect, so no casing: it has `charging` and `charged` instead, and an `fx_ejection_port`
--     slot with nothing hung on it.

        -- never puts a hand on this block during a reload. Both files are keyed to the same timeline, so at

        --
        --     the player's `pwa` GLB gives the left wrist relative to `WeaponRight`, which is where the gun hangs;

        -- THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT RIGHT IN BOTH STATES, which is what was asked for: the offset is relative to the
        -- SLOT, and the slot rides the block. Verified rather than assumed -- through the take's release the bone
        -- runs -83.9 -> -40.8 and the slot moves +43.1 mm, all of it in the along-bore term, 1:1. So the same grip

        --
        -- TRANSFERRING THE LIBERTY'S WHOLESALE COULD NOT WORK, and the reason is worth keeping: `off` is read in the
        -- weapon's own axes -- X across, Y ALONG THE BORE, Z up (all three confirmed on this weapon: the bore
        -- measures (0, +0.9999, -0.0112), the seated magazine stands on +Z, and the block's travel lands entirely
        -- in Y). The Liberty's slot sits mid-slide, this one's at the very rear of a 290 mm block, so its -0.0899
        -- put the wrist 90 mm BEHIND the gun and its -0.0341 put it 34 mm BELOW -- "хват далеко от затвора".
        --
        -- The measured hand sits 71 mm out to the LEFT, level with the block and level with the slot. The side is
        -- not from the export's handedness, which cannot be read off this rig (every bone has X = 0): it is from
        -- the take, where the left wrist measures negative X in the weapon's frame in every frame of every take.
        --
        -- The ROTATION stays the Liberty's, and so do the fingers, bar the ring and little opened 5 % (see the pose
        -- file) -- the fingers and the wrist turn are one measurement and the headset
        -- has already passed them ("поза работает"). The style gate is off: with a single grip there is nothing to
        -- disambiguate, so an orientation test can only refuse a grip that should have been offered.
        --
        -- ...AND BACK UP AGAIN, to exactly the measured value. It went 50 mm down in two passes on the way the hand
        -- looked while pulling the block, and came 50 mm back when the grip started being offered half a hand too
        -- low and, worse, when the magazine stopped being takeable at all.

        -- THE HAND ROLLS TO THE BASE AND PUSHES FROM THERE -- the same motion the Kenshin, the Lexington and the
        -- Omaha have, and it needs per-stage PLACEMENT, not just per-stage poses. Measured the same way it was on
        -- the Lexington, by tracking the hold slot's distance to the magazine's own floorplate through the push:
        --
        --     depth 375..115 mm   wrist 61-95 mm from the mount, 69-133 from the base   -- carried by the body
        --     depth 102..3  mm    wrist 96-118 from the mount, 18-38 from the base      -- the palm IS on the base
        --
        -- So the re-grip happens at about 110 mm, near the top of the run, and the ladder rolls the placement from
        -- the carry to the base over the next 40. The push end is measured on its tightest frames (t=3.31..3.40)
        -- and then carried into the same corrected frame the carry lives in, by applying the headset's own
        -- correction to it -- otherwise the roll would start in a tuned pose and end in an untuned one and jump.
