-- THE REVOLVER, on its own.
--
-- `reload.lua` is built around a gun with a slide and a box magazine, and by the twelfth pistol it knew that shape
-- very well. A revolver is not it: nothing slides, the cylinder swings out on a crane and turns about the bore, the
-- hammer is cocked and stays cocked, and what leaves the gun is six loose cases rather than one magazine. Piling
-- that into a 3400-line file made both harder to read, so it lives here.
--
-- Everything is driven from `M.frame(ctx)`, once per frame, with `ctx` carrying the handful of things the parent
-- already has: the weapon, its config, dt, which hand is which, and the pose helpers. Nothing here reaches back.

-- WHEN A CASE LEAVES ITS CHAMBER, from friction rather than from taste.
--
-- A case in a chamber is held by nothing but its own weight and the wall. Tip the cylinder and gravity splits into
-- a component ALONG the chamber, which pulls the case out, and one ACROSS it, which presses the case to the wall
-- and is all the friction has to work with. With the axis at `theta` from vertical those are `g*cos(theta)` and
-- `g*sin(theta)`, so it slides when
--
--     cos(theta) > mu * sin(theta)      i.e.   theta < atan(1 / mu)
--
-- Brass on oiled steel is mu ~ 0.2, dirty ~ 0.3; at 0.25 that is 76 deg from vertical, so the bore has to come up
-- about 14 deg above level before the first case moves. That is the number this returns, as a cosine to compare
-- against the bore's own vertical component -- no hand-picked threshold anywhere.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ SPENT CASES IN FLIGHT
--
-- Each leaves its OWN chamber, along the cylinder's axis, a moment after the one before -- six leaving as a ring is
-- the one thing a revolver never does. After that each is ballistic and tumbling on its own, and gone when its time
-- is up: a case is 30 mm of brass and nobody watches where it lands.
--
-- Their own list rather than the magazine's falling solver, which carries ONE body with contacts, resting and a
-- settle -- everything a magazine needs and nothing a case does.
-- `live` is how many of the chambers still hold an UNFIRED round, and it decides what is spawned in each: a live
-- round is a case with a bullet in it, a spent one is the same case without. They are two entities, because they
-- are two objects -- the game's own rig says as much, with a `bulletUsed01..06` track per chamber whose whole job
-- is to take the bullet off a case that has been fired.
--
-- The live ones fill the LAST chambers and the spent ones the first, so the two are contiguous the way a
-- part-fired cylinder really is -- a revolver indexes round in order, it does not fire at random.
