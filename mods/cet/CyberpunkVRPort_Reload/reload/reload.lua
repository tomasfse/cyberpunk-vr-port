-- CyberpunkVRPort — HAND-DRIVEN PHYSICAL RELOAD.
--
-- The weapon's parts (slide, magazine, hammer) are moved by the weapon's own animation; nothing in script can
-- touch them the ordinary way. But the plugin's pose-apply hook can, and `VRRigWrite(which, boneIndex, x, y, z)`
-- SETS a rig bone's parent-local translation each frame -- resolving the bone index to the shared pose buffer's
-- slot through the LIVE remap table, so it drives the right part (see memory weapon-rig-identification). This
-- module turns the free hand's motion into those writes: grab a part, move, and it follows; let go, it returns.
--
-- Per-weapon data (which bone, how far, grab zones) lives in reload/weapons/<id>.lua, so new weapons are a config
-- file, not code. Bones/travel/senses come from decoding the game's own reload animations, not guesses (memory
-- reload-animation-mechanics).
--
-- Frames: the free hand is read in MODEL space (VRHandRawModel); weapon parts are located from their vrp_ slots in
-- WORLD space and converted to model with the player's transform (same convention as the collision module). The
-- barrel direction is the model-space vector between the front and back slide slots; the free hand's travel
-- PROJECTED onto it is exactly the along-barrel rack distance, because a rotation preserves length -- so the bone's
-- own local frame never has to be reconstructed.

-- WHERE THE FINGER PADS ARE, WITHOUT ASKING THE FINGERS. A cylinder is ROLLED with the pads, and the tracked hand
-- point every other gesture in this module uses sits a palm's depth behind them -- so the spin zone had to be drawn
-- far wider than the part it touches, and engaged off the heel of the hand.
--
-- BUT THE PADS THEMSELVES CANNOT BE READ FROM THE POSED HAND, and that is a feedback loop with a one-frame delay --
-- the same shape as the magazine magnet's, learnt there the hard way. Reading bones 65/66 works, and then: the zone

-- fades, the fingers curl back, the zone catches again. That is the judder as the hand comes near, and why it settles
-- once the hand is properly on the cylinder -- deep inside the zone the loop cannot reach the edge.
--
-- So the point is anchored to the WRIST bone (23 left, 24 right), which nothing here writes to, by a constant offset

-- ------------------------------------------------------------- A DROPPED MAGAZINE
--
-- It is a spawned mesh entity with no collision of its own (the game will not simulate one for us -- see the
-- magazine block), so the fall is integrated here and the contacts come from a raycast against the real world.
-- What this replaces: a vertical fall from a standstill onto a floor ASSUMED to be at the player's own feet, ending
-- with the velocity zeroed and the orientation frozen at whatever angle the hand had.
--
-- The body is a box about 30 x 84 x 141 mm, read off the magazines' own bounding boxes and consistent across them
-- (Kenshin 30.1 x 84.0 x 141.4, Liberty/Unity 26.0 x 83.1 x 121.8, Tamayura 28.6 x 75.3 x 130.8), with LOCAL X the
-- thin axis and LOCAL Z the long one. Two numbers follow from that, and both matter on screen:
--   * `centre` -- the body's middle in its own axes, because a thrown object tumbles about its centre of mass, not
--     about the mesh origin, which sits on the face that goes into the well. The three bbox centres are
--     (1.4, -21.5, -63.5), (0, -22.0, -55.6) and (0, -20.0, -59.5) mm, so one number covers all of them; a magazine
--     whose origin is somewhere else already declares that difference as `mag.originOffset`, and it is subtracted.
--   * `flat` -- half the thin dimension: how high the centre sits once the magazine is lying on its side, which is
--     the pose it is put into when it stops.
--   * `long` and `thin` -- WHICH of the mesh's own axes those are. Every magazine in the set up to the Kang Tao Chao
--     is built the same way, long along local Z and thin across local X, so these were hardcoded; the Chao's is
--     built along local Y instead (its body measures 31.8 x 177.0 x 31.6 mm), and with the wrong axis the three
--     probes all sit inside the body, the ends go through the floor, and it lies down on its end.

-- TAKE THE SLIDE OFF THE GAME, or give it back. Not a guess -- read out of base\gameplaynim_graphs\weapon.animgraph:

--
-- The `reload` tag belongs to the state machine's `Reload` state, and that state is entered from ANY state by the
-- external event `Reload` (globalTransitions[0]); `InterruptReload` leaves it. So pushing `Reload` makes the game
-- stop applying the empty-slide pose at all, which is better than out-shouting it every frame.
--
-- Measured, so the limit is on the record: the event alone does NOT close the slide on screen -- inside the Reload
-- state the weapon's own reload clip holds it back instead (slide slot to muzzle slot stayed 0.1470 m, where closed
-- is 0.105). It removes the FIGHT over the bone; the position is still ours to write.

--   * INSIDE that state the clip is chosen by `ReloadData.emptyReload` -- and an EMPTY reload's clip holds the slide
--     back by itself, which is why pushing the event alone left the slide visibly back (slot distance stayed
--     0.1470 m against 0.105 closed). Saying "this reload is not an empty one" asks for the clip whose slide is home.
-- Sent every frame the claim stands, deliberately: re-sending on a timer made the graph alternate between two poses
-- and the whole weapon jumped 2-3 cm several times a second ("дуло прыгает вверх вниз").
-- `ReloadData` is the same channel the game's own weapon state machine uses (weaponTransitions.script:
-- `SetAnimationParameterFeature('ReloadData', m_animReloadData)`), so nothing here is off the beaten path.

-- game state has, while the hand beside it is drawn from the pose of the frame being rendered. The two are a
-- frame apart, and a frame apart IS speed: nothing standing still, a hand's width at a run, closing again the
-- moment the player stops. The weapon's own parts never had this -- VRRigWrite puts them in the pose that the
-- same frame draws -- so only entities need correcting.
--
-- WHAT IS EXTRAPOLATED IS THE TARGET ITSELF, per placed thing, and that is the whole of the second attempt. The
-- first led by the PLAYER ROOT's smoothed velocity, and it was wrong twice over on the ground that showed it:
--
--   * the root is not the anchor. Over a step or a kerb the character controller lifts the capsule while the
--     camera and the skeleton are eased up after it, so the hand and the root are briefly going different ways
--     and no amount of root velocity describes where the hand will be.
--   * a filter has its own lag. Smoothed over three frames, the estimate is right only while the speed is
--     steady -- which is exactly the flat ground where the problem was already small, and never on the bumps,
--     where the velocity changes faster than the filter follows. "всё равно на неровностях отстаёт".
--
-- So the estimate is the last observed STEP of the very point being placed -- root motion, step easing, arm
-- swing and all, whatever caused it -- and the next step is predicted as that one. No dt appears anywhere: a
-- step is already a per-frame quantity, so a frame that takes longer carries itself and a variable frame time
-- cannot distort the answer. The second-order term (predicting the CHANGE in the step) is deliberately not
-- taken: it buys a little on a ramp and doubles the noise, and the noise here is a difference of two anchors,
-- which is the one quantity that shows up as the magazine shaking against a hand that is not.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------- THE CARRIER
--
-- A mesh component that lives in the PLAYER'S OWN entity template, bound to `ItemAttachmentSlots` / `WeaponLeft`
-- and `WeaponRight` through an `entHardTransformBinding` (added by tools/ent/add_hold_components.py). The engine
-- carries it in the same pass that draws the hand, so it cannot be behind the hand -- not by a filter, not by a
-- prediction, by construction.
--
-- THIS REPLACES A SPAWNED ENTITY, AND THE REASON IS MEASURED. A world entity placed by SetWorldTransform reaches
-- the screen a frame after the hand it is placed against: at a run that frame is 21 cm, which is the magazine
-- floating clear of the palm. It is not the script's reading that is late -- the plugin's engine-side player
-- position and this script's own agree to under half a millimetre at 8 m/s -- so no amount of leading fixes it.
-- The script is simply not in that race. A component in the template is not in it either.
--
-- Verified live, 2026-08-16, with the carriers in place:
--     Toggle(true)                          the object appears in the hand
--     worldTransform vs the slot            separation 0.0000 m, both hands, read in ONE call
--     SetLocalTransform(pos, rot)           applies from the next frame; asked 0.0800, measured 0.0801
--     ChangeResource(ResRef, true)          swaps what is held; the ball became a Malorian magazine
--     component.mesh = '<path>'             DOES NOT take -- no error, and the old mesh keeps drawing
--
-- The last two lines are why the swap goes through ChangeResource and not through the obvious assignment.
--
-- ONE CARRIER IS ONE MESH, and that is a limit of this pair of components rather than of the idea: the Overture's
-- "magazine" is a speedloader of twelve meshes (six shells, six tips), which one component cannot draw. The
-- engine does it with more parts, and so can we -- the patcher writes a carrier in four lines and nothing stops
-- it writing six or twelve of them onto the same slot. Until that is needed, the revolver keeps the entity route
-- it already has in reload/revolver.lua, and the twelve box magazines move over.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------- A MANY-PART THING: A REAL ITEM
--
-- One carrier draws one mesh, and some props are not one mesh: the Overture's speedloader is seven
-- (six rounds and a handle) and lives in its own asset rather than on the weapon. What the game does
-- with a many-part thing in a hand is carry it as an ITEM, and it carries it exactly -- measured with
-- the loader attached, its world position and the WeaponLeft slot agreed to 0.0000 m.
--
-- FOUR THINGS HAD TO BE TRUE, and every one of them failed silently on the way (2026-08-16):
--   * the attach has to be made from REDSCRIPT. From CET `AddItemToSlot` returns true and attaches
--     nothing, at any argument count, while `RemoveItemFromSlot` from CET works -- so it is that one
--     function, not the boundary. Hence `VRPortHoldItem` in CyberpunkVRPort_Hold.
--   * the item's entity must be rooted in `gameItemObject`, not `entEntity`.
--   * that entity must carry a non-empty `appearances` list naming an .app.
--   * and the ArchiveXL factory csv must be a COOKED C2dArray, not text. Ours was text; ArchiveXL
--     logged "Loading factory" and got no rows, and the name resolved to nothing.
-- `true` from AddItemToSlot means the transaction was accepted and NOTHING about the slot, which is
-- why every check here reads the slot back instead.

    -- here: its whole upper section (`magazine_open`) swings 90 deg about the bore, and until it does there is no
    -- opening for a magazine to pass through. The game opens it as part of its reload CLIP -- which the physical
    -- reload never plays -- so without this the magazine would travel through a shut cover.
    --
    -- WHAT DRIVES IT is the magazine's own state, not a hand and not a timer: open whenever the magazine is anywhere
    -- but home, shut the moment it seats. That is exactly what the animation does, only keyed to the player instead
    -- of to a clip -- and it means it opens whether the magazine was dropped on B, pulled out by hand, or a fresh one
    -- was conjured for an empty gun.
    --
    -- The SHAPE of the swing is the animation's own, measured off `magazine_open` in `empty_reload`: it rocks about
    -- 6 deg the WRONG way over the first two frames of 0.167 s, then swings to 90 in the remaining 0.1. That
    -- wind-up is most of why a powered cover reads as powered rather than as a rotating number.
