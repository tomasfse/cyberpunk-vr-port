-- CyberpunkVRPort — VR basketball (tick bridge + measurement console).
--
-- The physics lives in redscript (VRBallTick). This module only supplies the real frame delta,
-- because the bounce top-up is computed from a numerically differentiated velocity and a wrong
-- dt shows up directly as a wrong impulse: v = dp/dt, and J = m*(e(v)-e_engine)*v.
--
-- Nothing here is a "feel" slider. The one number that must be measured before any of this is
-- trustworthy is the engine's own restitution, and DropTest() prints it.
--
-- Console (CET):
--   Game.GetPlayer():VRBallToggle()              spawn / despawn in front of you
--   Game.GetPlayer():VRBallSetCorrection(false)  raw engine bounce
--   Game.GetPlayer():VRBallDropTest(1.8)         drop from 1.8 m, prints e_effective
--   Game.GetPlayer():VRBallStatus()              position / kinematic / simulated

-- Take the body capsules out of scene QUERIES, and keep them out.
--
-- The arm capsules carry the "World Dynamic" filter, because that is the only preset MEASURED to give them
-- contacts at all -- "Player Hitbox" and "Ragdoll Inner" both let a ball fly straight through and land
-- 1.8 m behind the player. But world geometry is exactly what a character controller must not be standing
-- inside: every capsule overlaps the controller's 0.25 m cylinder, and the first attempt at this launched
-- the player into the sky.
--
-- A PhysX character controller moves by sweeping scene queries; a ball hits things by simulation contacts.
-- Clearing IsQueryable keeps the contacts and hides the capsules from the movement system, which is the
-- same trick that stopped the player climbing over the ball.
--
-- Re-applied on a timer rather than once: a component that re-registers (state change, teleport, reload)
-- would come back queryable, and one queryable frame at chest depth is a shove.
