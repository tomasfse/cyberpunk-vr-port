CyberpunkVRPort $Version
========================

WHAT THIS IS
    A VR mod for Cyberpunk 2077: stereo rendering through OpenXR, 6DoF head tracking, motion
    controllers merged into the game's own gamepad input, VRIK arms, and a set of gameplay mods
    (holsters, physical reload, melee, weapon handling, smoking). HUD placement is HUDitor's job
    now, and this package carries the port's HUDitor setup -- see WHAT LANDS WHERE.

BEFORE YOU INSTALL -- READ THIS ONE
    The first time the plugin starts it REPLACES your Cyberpunk settings with the ones this mod
    was tuned against:

        %LOCALAPPDATA%\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077\UserSettings.json

    Your own file is copied to UserSettings.pre-vr-<date>-<time>.json in the same folder first,
    and if that copy fails the install is abandoned rather than forced. It happens exactly once:
    afterwards the file is yours and nothing here looks at it again. Everything you change in the
    game's own menus sticks.

    first_launch=1 in bin\x64\vrport.ini means "not installed yet"; the plugin
    clears it to 0 once the copy has succeeded, and never looks again.

    To SKIP it entirely, including on the very first launch: create bin\x64\vrport.ini yourself,
    containing the single line first_launch=0, before you start the game. Creating it afterwards
    is too late -- the plugin writes that file and reads it in the same breath, so a fresh
    install has already been offered the settings by the time you can edit it.

    To ask for the settings later, set first_launch=1 and start the game once.

REQUIRED
    Cyberpunk 2077 2.31 -- this build's engine offsets are matched to it.
    An OpenXR runtime, started BEFORE the game. This comes with your headset software (VDXR,
        Meta, SteamVR, WMR); it is not a mod and not on Nexus.

    Nova Optics          https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/29190

    Install RED4ext, CET and redscript first.

    Nothing else may proxy dxgi. If bin\x64\dxgi.dll exists (R.E.A.L. VR installs one), move it
    out of the folder.

OPTIONAL
    HUDitor              https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3315
    Input Loader         https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4575
        Only for HUD placement. This package carries the port's HUDitor setup (the editor on
        F11, and a VR layout), and Input Loader is what merges r6\input\*.xml, so without it
        the F11 binding is inert. persistency.json REPLACES any HUDitor layout you already
        have -- back yours up first if you care about it. Without a HUD editor the flat-screen
        HUD is used unchanged, and the port still composites it into the second eye either way.

    Visible Bullets      https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22251

PREPARE THE GAME
    1. Install the required mods above and START THE GAME ONCE.

    2. Turn off overlays: OpenXR Toolkit, RivaTuner, the NVIDIA and Steam overlays, Discord.

    3. Graphics settings: everything on Low; Film Grain, Chromatic Aberration, Motion Blur,
       Lens Flare, Depth of Field and Frame Generation OFF; display mode borderless window.

    4. Coming from an earlier build of this mod? Delete bin\x64\dxgi.dll.

INSTALL
    Extract the contents of this folder into your Cyberpunk 2077 game root -- the folder that
    contains bin\, r6\, red4ext\ and archive\. The paths inside already match.

    With Vortex or MO2, install this zip as-is. Install the required mods first; the installer
    does not check them for you.

    Then start your OpenXR runtime, then the game. A small launcher window appears first: pick
    your headset and per-eye render resolution there.

WHAT LANDS WHERE
    red4ext\plugins\CyberpunkVR_Stereo\   the VR plugin, its shaders, the settings template
    bin\x64\CyberpunkVR_*Grip*.ini        captured hand poses for holding a cigarette and lighter
    bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\CyberpunkVRPort_*\

    r6\tweaks\vrport\, r6\tweaks\vrcigarette\
    archive\pc\mod\                       packed assets + the ArchiveXL manifest
    r6\input\HUDitor.xml               HUDitor's editor moved to F11 (needs input_loader)
    bin\x64\plugins\...\mods\HUDitor\persistency.json   the VR HUD layout -- REPLACES yours

    The player entity assets in cyberpunkvrport.archive carry one render-to-texture camera per
    supported resolution. The launcher offers exactly the ones that exist.

IF SOMETHING IS WRONG
    bin\x64\cyberpunkvrport.log            the plugin's own log, start here
    red4ext\logs\                          script validation errors land here
    bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\   per-mod CET logs

    Uninstall: run UNINSTALL.bat, in the same folder as this file. It removes every path this
    package added and then offers your own settings back. UNINSTALL.txt is the same thing
    written out by hand, including the two things neither of them can put back for you.

CyberpunkVRPort $Version -- UNINSTALL
=====================================

Run UNINSTALL.bat in this folder and it does all of part 1, 2 and 3 below for you, then offers to
put your own Cyberpunk settings back. This file is the same thing written out, for anyone who
would rather delete by hand or wants to know what the .bat touches before running it.

Nothing here installs to Windows. There is no installer, no registry key and no service: every
file this mod adds is inside the Cyberpunk 2077 game folder, and deleting them IS the uninstall.
The two lists below are generated from the package itself, so they name exactly what it added.

If you only want to TURN IT OFF for a session you need none of this. Delete
red4ext\plugins\CyberpunkVR_Stereo\CyberpunkVR_Stereo.dll and the game starts flat, with the CET
and redscript mods idle because the natives they call are gone with it.

1. DELETE THESE FOLDERS -- every one of them is ours, nothing else lives in them

$dirLines

2. DELETE THESE FILES -- these sit in folders that are NOT ours, so delete the file, not the folder

$looseLines

3. AND THESE -- the plugin writes them at runtime, so they are not in the package

    bin\x64\vrport.ini                     every setting you changed in the F10 overlay
    bin\x64\vrport-launcher.ini            the launcher's headset, resolution and DEBUG choice
    bin\x64\cyberpunkvrport.log            the plugin's log

4. THREE THINGS DELETING FILES DOES NOT UNDO -- read this part

    YOUR GAME SETTINGS. On its first launch the plugin replaced

        %LOCALAPPDATA%\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077\UserSettings.json

    with the one this mod was tuned against, and copied yours to
    UserSettings.pre-vr-<date>-<time>.json in the same folder. Removing the mod does not put it
    back. UNINSTALL.bat offers to; by hand, rename that backup over UserSettings.json yourself
    with the game closed. Skip it and you keep the mod's graphics, comfort and language settings
    for good.

    HUDITOR'S OWN BINDING FILE. r6\input\HUDitor.xml in the list above REPLACED the one HUDitor
    ships, to move its editor off F7 onto F11. Deleting ours leaves HUDitor with no binding file at
    all, so reinstall HUDitor -- or restore its own HUDitor.xml -- if you want the editor back. The
    game rebuilds r6\cache\inputUserMappings.xml from r6\input\*.xml on the next launch, so there
    is nothing to clean up there.

    YOUR HUD LAYOUT. persistency.json in the list above OVERWROTE whatever HUDitor layout you had.
    Deleting it leaves HUDitor to generate a default, which is not the layout you had before
    installing this unless you kept a copy.

5. IF YOU MOVED A dxgi.dll ASIDE FOR THIS MOD

    R.E.A.L. VR and some other VR mods install bin\x64\dxgi.dll, and this port cannot share a
    process with one, so you may have renamed it -- deploy_stereo.ps1 renames it to
    dxgi.dll.disabled-red4ext. Rename it back if you want that mod again.

6. WHAT IS NOT TOUCHED, so you do not go looking for it

    Your saves. Nothing here reads or writes them, and nothing this mod does is persisted into a
    save: no custom quest facts, no items that stop existing, no scripted entities parked in the
    world. A save made with the mod loads without it.

    The other mods this one requires -- RED4ext, Cyber Engine Tweaks, redscript, ArchiveXL,
    TweakXL, Codeware, Visual Holsters, Visible Bullets, Equipment-EX, Nova Optics, Input Loader,
    HUDitor. Each has its own uninstall; the lists above remove only what carries the
    CyberpunkVRPort name.
