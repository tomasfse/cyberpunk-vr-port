CyberpunkVRPort $Version
========================

WHAT THIS IS
    A VR mod for Cyberpunk 2077: stereo rendering through OpenXR, 6DoF head tracking, motion
    controllers merged into the game's own gamepad input, VRIK arms, and a set of gameplay mods
    (HUD placement, holsters, melee, weapon handling, smoking).

BEFORE YOU INSTALL -- READ THIS ONE
    The first time the plugin starts it REPLACES your Cyberpunk settings with the ones this mod
    was tuned against:

        %LOCALAPPDATA%\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077\UserSettings.json

    Your own file is copied to UserSettings.pre-vr-<date>-<time>.json in the same folder first,
    and if that copy fails the install is abandoned rather than forced. It happens exactly once:
    afterwards the file is yours and nothing here looks at it again. Everything you change in the
    game's own menus sticks.

    To skip it entirely: after the first launch creates bin\x64\vrport.ini, set first_launch=1 in
    it BEFORE starting the game a second time. To ask for it again later, set first_launch=0.

REQUIRED
    Cyberpunk 2077 2.31 -- this build's engine offsets are matched to it.
    An OpenXR runtime, started BEFORE the game. This comes with your headset software (VDXR,
        Meta, SteamVR, WMR); it is not a mod and not on Nexus.

    RED4ext              https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380
    Cyber Engine Tweaks  https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107
    redscript            https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511
    ArchiveXL            https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198
    TweakXL              https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197
    Codeware 1.20+       https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780
        An OLDER Codeware is worse than none: it compiles against an API that no longer matches
        and takes down redscript compilation for EVERY mod in the game, not just this one.

    Install RED4ext, CET and redscript first.

    Nothing else may proxy dxgi. If bin\x64\dxgi.dll exists (R.E.A.L. VR installs one), move it
    out of the folder -- two VR paths in one process fight over the same engine hooks.

OPTIONAL
    Each one turns a feature on. Without it that feature is off and nothing else changes.

    Equipment-EX         https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6945
        The outfit slots the VR smoking props attach to. Without it the cigarette and lighter
        have nowhere to render.
    Visual Holsters      https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/21936
        Only for IMMERSIVE hand-to-holster mode, which equips by visual holster. The SIMPLE
        mode (fixed weapon slots) works without it.

    Recommended, but referenced by nothing here -- what the port was tuned and played against:

    Visible Bullets      https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22251
    Nova Optics          https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/29190

INSTALL
    Extract the contents of this folder into your Cyberpunk 2077 game root -- the folder that
    contains bin\, r6\, red4ext\ and archive\. The paths inside already match.

    With Vortex or MO2, install this zip as-is: it carries a FOMOD installer that checks the six
    required mods above are present and refuses to install if one is not. It does NOT download
    them -- nothing inside a mod archive can -- so install them first. Note the check cannot see
    Codeware's VERSION, only that it is there.

    If it refuses while you DO have all six, hit Deploy in Vortex and install again. The check
    reads the GAME folder, so a requirement sitting in Vortex's staging folder -- installed but
    not yet deployed -- reads as missing.

    Then start your OpenXR runtime, then the game. A small launcher window appears first: pick
    your headset and per-eye render resolution there.

WHAT LANDS WHERE
    red4ext\plugins\CyberpunkVR_Stereo\   the VR plugin, its shaders, the settings template
    red4ext\plugins\CyberpunkVR_Hands\    avatar / VRIK / weapon / smoking natives
    bin\x64\CyberpunkVR_*Grip*.ini        captured hand poses for holding a cigarette and lighter
    bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\CyberpunkVRPort_*\
    r6\scripts\CyberpunkVRPort_*\
    r6\tweaks\vrcigarette\
    archive\pc\mod\                       packed assets + the ArchiveXL manifest

    The player entity assets in cyberpunkvrport.archive carry one render-to-texture camera per
    supported resolution. The launcher offers exactly the ones that exist.

IF SOMETHING IS WRONG
    bin\x64\cyberpunkvrport.log            the plugin's own log, start here
    red4ext\logs\                          script validation errors land here
    bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\   per-mod CET logs

    Uninstall: delete the files listed above. Nothing is written outside the game folder except
    the settings file named at the top, and its backup sits next to it.
