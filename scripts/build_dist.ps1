========================

WHAT THIS IS
    A VR mod for Cyberpunk 2077: stereo rendering through OpenXR, 6DoF head tracking, motion
    controllers merged into the game's own gamepad input, VRIK arms, and a set of gameplay mods
    (holsters, physical reload, melee, weapon handling, smoking). HUD placement is HUDitor's job
    now, and this package carries the port's HUDitor setup -- see WHAT LANDS WHERE.

BEFORE YOU INSTALL -- READ THIS ONE
    The first time the plugin starts it REPLACES your Cyberpunk settings with the ones this mod
    was tuned against:

        %LOCALAPPDATA%\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077\UserSettings.json

    Your own file is copied to UserSettings.pre-vr-<date>-<time>.json in the same folder first,
    and if that copy fails the install is abandoned rather than forced. It happens exactly once:
    afterwards the file is yours and nothing here looks at it again. Everything you change in the
    game's own menus sticks.

    first_launch=1 in bin\x64\vrport.ini means "not installed yet"; the plugin
    clears it to 0 once the copy has succeeded, and never looks again.

    To SKIP it entirely, including on the very first launch: create bin\x64\vrport.ini yourself,
    containing the single line first_launch=0, before you start the game. Creating it afterwards
    is too late -- the plugin writes that file and reads it in the same breath, so a fresh
    install has already been offered the settings by the time you can edit it.

    To ask for the settings later, set first_launch=1 and start the game once.

REQUIRED
    Cyberpunk 2077 2.31 -- this build's engine offsets are matched to it.
    An OpenXR runtime, started BEFORE the game. This comes with your headset software (VDXR,
        Meta, SteamVR, WMR); it is not a mod and not on Nexus.

    RED4ext              https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380
    Cyber Engine Tweaks  https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107
    redscript            https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511

    TweakXL              https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197
    Codeware 1.20+       https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780

    Install RED4ext, CET and redscript first.

    HUDitor, plus RED4ext's input_loader -- ONLY if you want HUD placement. This package carries
    the port's HUDitor setup (the editor on F11, and a VR layout), and input_loader is the plugin
    that merges r6\input\*.xml, so without it the F11 binding is inert. Note that
    persistency.json REPLACES any HUDitor layout you already have -- back yours up first if you
    care about it. The port needs neither: with no HUD editor the flat-screen HUD is used
    unchanged, and the port still composites it into the second eye either way.

    Nothing else may proxy dxgi. If bin\x64\dxgi.dll exists (R.E.A.L. VR installs one), move it
    out of the folder.

OPTIONAL
    Equipment-EX         https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6945
        VR smoking props.
    Visual Holsters      https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/21936
        Immersive holster mode. The simple mode works without it.

    Recommended:

PREPARE THE GAME
    1. Install the required mods above and START THE GAME ONCE.

    2. Turn off overlays: OpenXR Toolkit, RivaTuner, the NVIDIA and Steam overlays, Discord.

    3. Graphics settings: everything on Low; Film Grain, Chromatic Aberration, Motion Blur,
       Lens Flare, Depth of Field and Frame Generation OFF; display mode borderless window.

    4. Coming from an earlier build of this mod? Delete bin\x64\dxgi.dll.

INSTALL
    Extract the contents of this folder into your Cyberpunk 2077 game root -- the folder that
    contains bin\, r6\, red4ext\ and archive\. The paths inside already match.

    With Vortex or MO2, install this zip as-is. Install the required mods first; the installer
    does not check them for you.

    Then start your OpenXR runtime, then the game. A small launcher window appears first: pick
    your headset and per-eye render resolution there.

WHAT LANDS WHERE
    red4ext\plugins\CyberpunkVR_Stereo\   the VR plugin, its shaders, the settings template
    bin\x64\CyberpunkVR_*Grip*.ini        captured hand poses for holding a cigarette and lighter
    bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\CyberpunkVRPort_*\
    r6\scripts\CyberpunkVRPort_*\
    r6\tweaks\vrcigarette\
    archive\pc\mod\                       packed assets + the ArchiveXL manifest
    r6\input\HUDitor.xml               HUDitor's editor moved to F11 (needs input_loader)
    bin\x64\plugins\...\mods\HUDitor\persistency.json   the VR HUD layout -- REPLACES yours

    The player entity assets in cyberpunkvrport.archive carry one render-to-texture camera per
    supported resolution. The launcher offers exactly the ones that exist.

IF SOMETHING IS WRONG
    bin\x64\cyberpunkvrport.log            the plugin's own log, start here
    red4ext\logs\                          script validation errors land here
    bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\   per-mod CET logs

    Uninstall: delete the files listed above. Nothing is written outside the game folder except
    the settings file named at the top, and its backup sits next to it.
