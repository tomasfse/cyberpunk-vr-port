# CyberpunkVR Port

A 6-DoF **VR mod for Cyberpunk 2077**, built as a **RED4ext plugin** -
`CyberpunkVR_Stereo` is the ONLY native plugin: it drives OpenXR head
tracking, real stereo, the in-headset overlay and the **full-body VR avatar with
motion-controlled hands** that used to live in a second DLL; and a set of CET / redscript mods add VR
weapon aiming, the physical reload, motion melee, hand-to-holster equipping and more. Everything is
configured from an in-headset **F10** overlay.

## Credits

- **[iPowerTech](https://github.com/iPowerTech)** — **VR driving.** Grabbing the
  wheel with your own hands, the steering geometry, the deadzone and lock-angle
  controls, the horn on the wheel hub, and shooting while you drive are all his
  work, from [his fork](https://github.com/iPowerTech/cyberpunk-vr-port).
  

## Features

- **Real stereo, not reprojection.** The second eye is an actual engine view — a
  render-to-texture camera on the player entity that runs the frame graph for its
  own eye, from its own position, with its own projection. It falls back to mono
  automatically whenever that view has nothing fresh to give (menus, loading).
- **OpenXR head tracking** injected into the REDengine render path, with the
  submitted frustum matching the one the engine actually rendered on both axes,
  plus world-scale / IPD controls. Off-axis lenses (Quest 3 and family) get a
  frustum sized to COVER the panel rather than match its span, so there is no
  black band down the outer edge.
- **The game HUD in both eyes** — the engine's own HUD composite is ported
  shader-for-shader for the second eye. By default it is pasted at the same
  PIXEL in both eyes so markers land in the same place; the finite-distance
  placement is still there behind one setting, because wide-FOV headsets want it.
- **The F10 overlay in both eyes**, so a settings panel no longer costs you
  stereo the way a full-screen game menu does.
- **The two views agree.** Sun cascade shadows, the shader clock, the foliage
  wind volume and the reflection march are all shared engine structures that the
  second view used to rebuild from its own frustum — which is where blinking
  shadows, dead flags, jittering vegetation and a mirror-finish ceiling came
  from. All four are lent from one view now.
- **Full-body VR avatar** (VRIK) — body under the HMD, arm-length calibration,
  leg IK, real-life squat. Hands are with the controllers, the shoulder girdle
  and elbows hang off the BODY rather than the head, and the solve is clocked by
  the engine's own animation batch. VRIK suspends itself during cutscenes so the
  avatar does not fight an authored scene.
- **Physical body rotation** (optional) — the character turns to follow the
  headset through the engine's own heading channel, so the mesh, the collision
  capsule, the aim and the movement direction all move with it. The view does not
  move and the hands stay on the controllers.
- **The physical reload.** Grab the magazine with your free hand's grip, pull it
  out along the path the weapon's own well defines, carry it, push it home; rack
  the slide with the other palm and release it with the right stick click. Ammo
  and sound follow the hands, not a timeline. **Thirteen weapons** are tuned
  individually — Unity, Tamayura, Tsunami Nue, Constitutional Liberty, Arasaka
  Kenshin, Militech Lexington, Militech Omaha, Kang Tao Chao, Tsunami Kappa,
  Arasaka Yukimura, Militech Ticon, Silverhand's Malorian, and the Malorian
  Overture revolver, which rolls its cylinder, ejects its cases and reloads from
  a real speedloader.
- **Decoupled VR weapon aim** — bullets follow the real weapon muzzle, not the
  camera. The hit is redirected inside the engine's own `PhysicalRay` evaluator,
  so shotgun spread stays spread and every other shooter in the world keeps
  firing from their own barrel. Optional barrel dot in both eyes, scope-zoom
  aware.
- **Recoil in the hands, not the camera** — the shot turns the wrist on a damped
  spring, and every weapon kicks by its own measured amount.
- **A resting hand and a real two-handed hold** — with a weapon out the empty
  hand relaxes instead of clawing at nothing, and bringing it to the weapon
  offers the support grip: squeeze and the wrist locks on, the off hand steers
  the aim, and the kick drops. Twelve weapons have a captured hold.
- **Collimated reflex sights** — the reticle is placed by angle along the sight's
  own optical axis, so it stays on the bore instead of sliding across the glass
  when you look at the sight from the side.
- **VR motion melee** — real swings trigger the game's native melee along the
  blade (native damage/reaction/stamina).
- **Hand-to-holster** equip/unequip on a grip squeeze — *immersive* (by visual
  holster) or *simple* (fixed weapon slots).
- **VR smoking** — cigarette and lighter as real props, with a captured
  finger grip, a hands-free mouth anchor and the game's own FX and audio.
- **VR controller mapping** merged into XInput: one movement speed whatever the
  stick deflection, sprint on a held detent, dash and crouch on the right stick,
  the scanner as a one-hand gesture, snap or smooth turn, HMD/hand-relative
  locomotion, and a D-pad chord. See **Controls** below.
- **VR driving** — squeeze a grip with your hand where the driving animation
  holds the wheel and that arm is handed back to the animation; the tilt of the
  line through your controllers is the steering, one-handed or two, with
  adjustable deadzone and lock angle. A hand on the hub sounds the horn, and
  drawing a weapon turns the right trigger into the gun while the throttle
  latches so the car keeps rolling.
- **World-map head-lock** — DLSS/NGX handling (the second
  view gets its own upscaler viewport automatically).
- **13 headsets, 60 resolutions**, every ladder reaching 6000 px, picked before
  launch — PlayStation VR2 and the Bigscreen Beyond 2/2e included.
- **HUD placement is HUDitor**, which moves and scales each
  widget individually. The port shipped its own HUD mod until 2026-08-20 and it
  is gone: it scaled the shared HUD root around screen centre, which is too
  blunt to be comfortable and actively fights a real HUD editor. What the port
  still does for the HUD is the part only it can do -- compositing the engine's
  own HUD into the SECOND eye. The port's own HUDitor setup -- the editor moved
  to **F11**, plus a VR-tuned layout for all 26 widgets -- is saved in
  `mods\config\huditor\`, opt-in rather than installed for you.
- **The cascade shadow rows are hidden** from *Graphics → Advanced*. The atlas is
  shared between the two views, so raising them gives you artefacts the port
  cannot fix from its side.
- **In-headset F10 overlay** with tabbed, live, persisted settings.
- SteamVR (OpenVR) runtime supported alongside OpenXR; pre-launch resolution
  selector; quiet-by-default logging with a DEBUG toggle in the launcher.

## Installation dependencies

All on Nexus except the OpenXR runtime, which comes with your headset software.

**Required**

- Cyberpunk 2077 (PC, **2.31**)
- [RED4ext](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380)
- [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107)
- [redscript](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511)
- [ArchiveXL](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198)
- [TweakXL](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197)
- [Codeware](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780) — 1.20 or newer
- [Equipment-EX](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6945)
- [Visual Holsters (Automatic Clothes Swap)](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/21936)
- [Nova Optics](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/29190)
- An OpenXR runtime, started **before** the game

Install RED4ext, CET and redscript first.

**Optional**

- [HUDitor](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3315) and
  [Input Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4575) — only for HUD
  placement. This package carries the port's HUDitor setup (the editor on F11, and
  a VR layout in `mods\config\huditor\`), and Input Loader is what merges
  `r6\input\*.xml`, so without it the F11 binding is inert. Note that
  `persistency.json` **replaces** any HUDitor layout you already have. Without a HUD
  editor the flat-screen HUD is used unchanged, and the port still composites it
  into the second eye either way.
- [Visible Bullets](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22251)

## Development dependencies

What a **contributor** needs. None of this is required to play.

To build the plugins:

- CMake 3.24+, MSVC (x64 toolset), the Windows SDK, and `pwsh`.
- Submodules: MinHook, RED4ext.SDK — `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- Pulled automatically by `FetchContent` on configure: OpenXR-SDK 1.0.34,
  imgui 1.90.9. `im3d` is vendored in `externals/`.

Only to re-author game assets — not needed to build or to change any C++:

- Python 3, for `tools/gen_vrcam_assets.py` (the VRCAM components, one per
  render resolution).
- WolvenKit, to import the generated JSON and repack the `.archive`.

The sight shaders ship as pre-built `.dxil` blobs committed to the repo; there is
no shader compilation step in the build. The other passes (depth resolve, colour
blit, sharpen) compile their HLSL at runtime through `d3dcompiler`.

## Installation

### Before you install

1. Install the required mods and **start the game once**.
2. Turn off overlays — OpenXR Toolkit, RivaTuner, the NVIDIA and Steam overlays,
   Discord.
3. Graphics settings: everything **Low**; Film Grain, Chromatic Aberration,
   Motion Blur, Lens Flare, Depth of Field and Frame Generation **off**; display
   mode **borderless window**.
4. Coming from an earlier build of this mod? Delete `bin\x64\dxgi.dll`.

### Which file to download

`CyberpunkVRPort-<version>.zip` — that one is the mod.

A release also carries `CyberpunkVRPort-<version>-symbols.zip`. That is debug
symbols, for reading a crash dump; it contains no mod and installs nothing. The
two are almost the same size, so go by the name rather than by the size.

### With Vortex or MO2

Install the release zip as-is. It does not check the required mods for you —
install those first.

### By hand

Extract the contents of the release zip into your **Cyberpunk 2077 game root**
(the folder that contains `bin\`, `r6\`, `red4ext\`). The files land as:

```
red4ext\plugins\CyberpunkVR_Stereo\CyberpunkVR_Stereo.dll     # the VR plugin: OpenXR, stereo, overlay, VRIK
red4ext\plugins\CyberpunkVR_Stereo\CyberpunkVR_Sight*.dxil    # sight shaders, loaded by name at PSO swap
                                                              # NOTE: CyberpunkVR_Hands.dll is GONE -- its
                                                              # code is inside CyberpunkVR_Stereo.dll now.
                                                              # An old copy left in red4ext\plugins makes
                                                              # two plugins detour one address, which
                                                              # crashes with a fault at FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
archive\pc\mod\cyberpunkvrport.archive                        # held props, weapon assets, the VRCAM cameras
archive\pc\mod\VRCigarette.archive.xl, vrport_basketball...   # the smoking and basketball props
bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\CyberpunkVRPort_*\   # CET mods -- see the table below
r6\scripts\CyberpunkVRPort_*\                                 # redscript mods -- see the table below
r6\input\HUDitor.xml, r6\config\...                           # the HUDitor binding and the port's config
```

Then **start your OpenXR runtime first**, and launch the game.

> There is no `dxgi.dll` any more — this is a RED4ext plugin. Anything else that
> proxies dxgi (R.E.A.L. VR, for one) must be out of `bin\x64` or the two fight
> over the same engine hooks; `scripts\deploy_stereo.ps1` moves one aside for you.

> Keep only one `.dll` in each `red4ext\plugins\CyberpunkVR_*` folder. RED4ext
> loads **every** DLL it finds there, so a renamed backup beside the real build
> loads as a second copy of the plugin and the two fight over the same hooks.

From a source tree, install with:

```
cmake --build build --config Release --target cyberpunkvrport_stereo
pwsh scripts\deploy_stereo.ps1 -GameRoot "<game root>"
```

## Builds and releases

Packages are produced by GitHub Actions, not by hand. Every push gets an
installable zip as a run artifact, versioned from `VERSION` at the repo root:
`0.1.2-dev.<short-sha>` on a feature branch, `0.1.2-rc.N` on `main` (tagged as
it is built), and a plain `0.1.2` release cut manually by promoting one of those
rc builds — the same binaries, not a rebuild. See [docs/BUILD-CI.md](docs/BUILD-CI.md).

## Controls

VR controller input is merged into the native CP2077 gamepad, so the in-game
"Controller" key bindings apply. Default VR mapping, **on foot**:

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Left stick | Move — **one speed whatever the deflection**, direction from the stick |
| Left stick **fully forward, held 0.2 s** | **Sprint** — held, and it survives a dash |
| Right stick X | Turn camera (snap or smooth; a snap needs a FULL push) |
| Right stick **fully up** | **Dash** (dodge, direction from the left stick) — once per push |
| Right stick **fully down** | **Crouch** (R3) |
| Right thumb **click** | **Slide release** — racks the weapon (physical reload) |
| Left hand to your **left ear** + **left grip** | **Scanner**, *toggled* — squeeze to open, squeeze again to close |
| Right trigger / Left trigger | Fire / Aim (left trigger is also melee block) |
| Right grip | Hand-to-holster equip / unequip; melee power modifier |
| Left grip | **Grab the magazine** during a reload (at the ear it is the scanner) |
| Left stick **up / down, to the stop** | Page the quickhack list *while the scanner is open* |
| A | Jump (double jump and charge jump unchanged) |
| B, **weapon in hand** | **Drop the magazine** (physical reload) — not dodge |
| B, **holstered** | The game's own B again — close the phone, back out |
| X / Y | Reload·interact / Weapon switch |
| Left menu button | Pause menu |
| Swing a melee weapon | VR motion melee (native attack along the blade) |

While the scanner is open the same hand works it: the **left stick to the stop**
pages the quickhack list (below the stop it still walks, so you can read and move),
**X** applies the selected hack, the **right trigger** tags the target instead of
firing, the **right stick click** changes the tab and **left trigger + right stick**
zooms. The list used to sit on X and Y, which meant reaching across the face buttons
with the hand that is already holding a grip at your ear — the very reach a one-hand
scanner exists to avoid.

B is the port's only while a weapon is actually in your hand, because a magazine
drop is the only thing the port needs it for. Holstered, it reaches the game — so
the phone and the radial close normally. *Known limit: with a weapon drawn, B
cannot close the phone.*

While **driving**, the same controllers do something else:

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Grip, hand at the wheel / handlebars | Grab it — that arm goes back to the driving animation |
| Tilt of the line through both controllers | Steering (one hand: that controller against the wheel centre) |
| Hand on the **middle of the wheel** | **Horn** — no grip needed; a hand that is grabbing never honks |
| Right trigger / Left trigger | Throttle / Brake |
| Right trigger **with a weapon drawn** | **Fire.** The throttle latches at the speed it had |
| Left stick forward / back, weapon drawn | Trim the latched throttle |
| **X, held** | **Get out.** B is never the exit in a car, so no stray press can eject you |
| Perspective toggle | **Does nothing** — the camera is held in first person |
| A | **Confirm a dialogue line** (it is X on foot, and X is the exit in here) — the handbrake still fires |

Each hand is independent, so you can hold the wheel with one and keep the other on
a gun. With a weapon equipped the right hand shoots and cannot grab the wheel;
holster it and the wheel is its again — and since reaching for a holster is how you
draw in the first place, that hand is already off the wheel by then. A grip that is
holding the wheel does nothing else: no holster equip, no magazine grab. Nothing
here needs to know which vehicle you are in, because the reference pose is the
game's own driving animation — bikes included.

The exit is a HOLD rather than a tap on purpose. The game's `ExitVehicle_Button`
carries no hold of its own, so the vehicle acts on the first frame it sees the
action — and at speed acting on it means throwing you out of the car.

**D-pad chord.** Hold the **left stick clicked in**, then pick the direction with
the **right stick** — up / down / left / right, **to the stop**, the same full push
every other gesture here asks for so that a resting thumb cannot step a list. While
the chord is held the right stick is taken out of the camera, so selecting a
direction cannot snap-turn you.
Release the left stick *without* having chosen a direction and it emits the normal
L3 press instead, so nothing is lost by using it.

Buttons follow each runtime's interaction profile (Touch / Index / Vive / WMR);
customise the actual actions in the game's *Settings → Key Bindings → Controller*.

Hotkeys:

- `F7` — recenter HMD
- `F8` — toggle the VR menu rectangle between full-HMD and a small panel
- `F10` / `Insert` — open the in-headset settings overlay
- `F11` — HUDitor's editor, if you installed it (the port rebinds it off F7)

## In-headset overlay (F10)

Four tabs, live, and saved to `vrport.ini` — nothing here needs a restart. The
**driving** block sits under Controls: wheel grab and its grab radius, steering
deadzone and full-lock angle, horn on/off with its hub radius,
trigger-fires-the-gun with its throttle trim rate — plus a live read-out of what
is grabbed, what the steering is doing and whether the horn is being pressed.

- **General** — world scale, IPD scale, stereo separation, VR menu FOV and quad
  size, motion prediction, reuse-last-clean-frame, pose pair-lock, and the head
  offset (X right / Y forward / Z up), with a second set that applies only in a
  vehicle.
- **Controls** — decoupled weapon aim and its laser dot, locomotion source
  (Game / HMD / left hand / right hand), snap turn and angle, immersive holsters,
  the driving block, and the current binding list.
- **Stereo** — the second eye itself: which eye VRCAM is sent to, how stale its
  last frame may get before the submit falls back to mono, the HUD composite, and
  the live counters that say whether the second view is producing, being captured
  and reaching the headset.
- **VRIK** — start/stop tracking, physical body rotation and its free-look cone,
  the cutscene-suspend tier, IK calibration (reach scale, height, elbow
  swing/pole, wrist offset), diagnostics.

The launcher (before the game starts) picks the render resolution and carries a
**DEBUG** tick-box that arms every diagnostic probe at once. Leave it off for
play: it is for diagnosis and it costs both frame time and a very large log.

## Mod components

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CyberpunkVR_Stereo.dll` | RED4ext plugin | OpenXR head tracking, the second engine view, HUD composite, sight shaders, F10 overlay, XInput merge |
| `CyberpunkVR_Stereo.dll` | (same plugin) | Full-body avatar / hand IK, hand recoil, weapon-aim and muzzle override, smoking and reload poses, shared-memory bridge -- was `CyberpunkVR_Hands.dll` until the single-plugin build |
| `cyberpunkvrport.archive` | archive | The magazine/prop carriers on the player templates, the weapon assets the reload drives, the case-ejection effects, and the 62 VRCAM camera components |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_Stereo` | CET | Enables the VRCAM component the launcher picked |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_VRIK` | CET | Starts hand tracking, bridges calibration, publishes the locomotion state |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_Weapon` | CET | Decoupled weapon aim + VR motion-melee detection |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_Reload` | CET | The physical reload — thirteen per-weapon configs, the magazine, the slide, the revolver cylinder |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_HandCollision` | CET | Hand / finger / weapon push-out. **Off since 0.1.2** (`COLL_ON = false`) — the body capsules came back out of the archive after a vehicle launched the player |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_Crosshair` | CET | Hides the game's own crosshair while decoupled VR aim is on |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_Holster` | CET + reds | Hand-to-holster equip/unequip (immersive / simple) |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_Smoking` | CET + reds | Cigarette / lighter props, FX, audio, auto-puff |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_Basketball` | CET + reds | VR basketball with real ball values (the physics half is redscript) |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_WorldMap` | CET + reds | World-map head-lock |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_Hold` | reds | Puts a real item in a hand — `AddItemToSlot` works from redscript and silently does nothing from CET. This is how the Overture's speedloader is carried |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_Melee` | reds | Native melee along the blade segment |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_WeaponUp` | reds | Stops auto-lower / auto-unequip of a drawn MELEE weapon |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_NoAnims` | reds | Disables VR-fighting animations (keeps gameplay systems); also carries no-auto-reload and the firearm half of no-auto-lower |
| `CyberpunkVRPort_SettingsGuard` | reds | Removes the two cascade shadow rows from the settings menu |

## Logs

- `Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\cyberpunkvrport.log` — the plugin's own log, and the
  right file for a bug report. Quiet by default; tick **DEBUG** in the launcher
  for per-frame diagnostics.
- `Cyberpunk 2077\red4ext\logs\` — script validation and plugin load errors. If
  redscript compilation fails, *every* redscript mod is off, not just the one that
  failed, so check here first when something stops working all at once.
- Per-mod CET logs live in each mod folder; they follow the same DEBUG switch.
