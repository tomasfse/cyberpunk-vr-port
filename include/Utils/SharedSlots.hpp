// ============================================================================
// CyberpunkVR_Hands_Shared -- THE shared-memory float block (single source of
// truth for slot numbering). All three C++ modules map the SAME named mapping:
//   vr_core.cpp      (GetShotShared)        -- render/present threads
//   openxr_manager.cpp  (SetSharedSlot/sShared) -- OpenXR present thread
//   red4ext_plugin      (g_pSharedHands)        -- game/anim threads + Lua natives
// Size: 1024 bytes = 256 floats (mapped as 1024 in every module).
//
// NUMBERING IS FROZEN. CET Lua reads RAW indices through GetVRSharedSlot
// (Holster mod: [20..23], [49]) -- renumbering breaks shipped mods. New data
// takes the lowest free slot from the GRAVEYARD below or fresh space >= [151].
//
// Cross-thread rules:
//  * [127] seqlock (odd = write in progress) brackets the OpenXR hand/HMD
//    publish; the plugin latches a whole coherent frame (RefreshHandsSnapshot).
//  * [143] seqlock brackets the dxgi render-view packet [104..111] + [141..142].
//  * Everything else is single-writer / relaxed (float-atomic on x64).

//             snap tick, releasing when [99] advances; the hook DEFERS the packet
//             rotation while [99] == [150] so the held frame keeps the pre-snap pose.
