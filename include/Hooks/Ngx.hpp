// Read-only NGX (DLSS) EvaluateFeature hook.
//
// Goal: capture the engine's per-frame Motion Vector resource (+ depth +
// scaling factors + reset flag) at the moment DLSS evaluates a frame. These
// are ground-truth velocity / depth signals the game ALREADY computes for
// DLSS, so they cost us nothing extra. We never modify NGX state — just
// AddRef captured pointers into global storage that the submit path can read
// consume for forward extrapolation (motion-vector-driven frame extrapolation
// instead of our current backward optical-flow midpoint).
//
// Second-stage goal (not in this header): per-eye DLSS history via cloned
// feature handles. Architecturally invasive — must come after we have proof
// that read-only capture is stable.
