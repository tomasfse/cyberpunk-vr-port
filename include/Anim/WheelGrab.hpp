//
// PLAIN GLOBALS, not shared slots. The upstream version (iPowerTech, wip motioncontroller vehicle
// steering) published thirteen of these into the shared block because it had to cross from the hands
// plugin to the dxgi proxy; that proxy is gone and both ends are this one DLL now, so the only thing
// still crossing a boundary is the armed mask the CET mods read (vrshared::kWheelArmedMask).
//
// Atomic because the producer and the consumers are different threads: the pose hook writes them on
// the engine's animation thread, the XInput detour reads them on the input thread and the overlay on
// the present thread.
extern std::atomic<float> g_wheelBlendRight;   // 0 = arm IK drives the hand, 1 = the animation does
extern std::atomic<float> g_wheelBlendLeft;
extern std::atomic<float> g_wheelSteer;        // -1 full left .. +1 full right, faded by the blend
extern std::atomic<float> g_wheelSteerDeg;     // the raw angle, for the overlay read-out
extern std::atomic<int>   g_wheelHornMask;     // a hand is on the hub: vrshared::kWheelArmed*Bit

// Called from the pose hook, in this order, once per FRESH solve:
//
//   WheelCaptureAnim   right after the first VRIK_ComputeFK, where the buffer still holds the pure
//                      ANIMATED pose -- that FK hand IS the hand the driving animation puts on the
//                      wheel, and three lines later the segment lengths are rescaled and it stops
//                      being the animation's answer.
//   WheelUpdate        proximity, grab state and the blends.
//   WheelHandsOff      true once an arm is entirely the animation's: no solve, no length scale, no
//                      clavicle write, no cache entry.
//   WheelStoreTarget   the controller target this solve built, which is what the NEXT solve measures
//                      against the animated hand. Must keep being recorded while the arm is handed
//                      over, or letting go could never re-arm.
//   WheelBlendTarget   blends the IK target toward the animated hand. A no-op at blend 0.
//   WheelSteerUpdate   after both arm blocks, where both targets are this solve's and the body
//                      right/up axes that define the wheel's plane are in scope.
