// What a hook file needs from the core hub, and nothing else.
//
// This header exists so a hook can move into its own translation unit without dragging the hub
// along. It deliberately declares only what hooks actually read or write across the boundary --
// if this file starts growing a member for every global in VrCore.cpp, the split has failed and
// the monolith has merely been spread out.
//
// EVERY GLOBAL DECLARED HERE HAS EXTERNAL LINKAGE ON PURPOSE. Several are handed to
// WriteMovRaxImm64 at install time, i.e. their ADDRESS is baked into a patch as an imm64. Turn one
// into a file-static, a function-local static or a thread_local during a later tidy-up and it
// still compiles, still links, and the patch reads the wrong memory for the rest of the process's
// life. There is no diagnostic for that; this note is the diagnostic.
