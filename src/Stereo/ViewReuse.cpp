//
// Sky, clouds, distant shadows, local shadows and global illumination. Each of these is expensive and
// each is, to a very good approximation, the same for two eyes 65 mm apart -- so the detours here
// either let the second view read the first view's result or skip its producer outright.
//
// Two rules this family has already cost real bugs to learn, both recorded at their use sites:
//
//   * Skipping a producer while leaving its feature bit SET is deliberate: downstream consumers must
//     still run, reading what the first view produced. Clearing the bit instead makes the second eye
//     lose the effect entirely.
//   * Only the primary view's cloud wind offsets advance, so the second view's clouds stand still
//     unless the offsets are mirrored per frame. That is what the cloud constant-buffer machinery
//     below is for, and it is why it copies a snapshot rather than sharing a pointer.

// MEASURED live in both views (x64dbg, breakpoint inside CRenderNode_RenderVolumetricClouds
// sub_14061B5B4 right after it resolves its view object): the cloud parameter block at
// viewData+0x550 is byte-identical between MAIN and VRCAM for its first 0x9C bytes, and then
// differs in EXACTLY six floats at +0x9C..+0xB3 -- the wind-scroll offsets of the three
// cloud-noise octaves. MAIN carried the offsets accumulated over the session,
//     (-29.50, -255.00)   (-39.29, -412.05)   (-49.58, -433.98)
// while VRCAM's were ZERO and stayed zero: the engine only ever advances the primary view's.
// sub_140784654 multiplies those six by 0.1 into the cloud constant buffer as the UV offsets
// of the three noise layers, so the two eyes sample the cloud field in completely different
// places -- different shapes, a cloud present in one eye and absent in the other, and no
// convergence while standing still (which is what ruled temporal accumulation out).
//
// It has to be done per frame: the view object comes from a pool and is a different address
// every frame (proven -- a one-shot poke of the six floats was gone by the next hit), and the
// fresh one always arrives zeroed.
//
// ONLY those six values are mirrored. Copying the whole buffer was tried first and is WRONG:
// it makes VRCAM's clouds disappear entirely (tested live, both variants). The buffer also
// carries fields that are genuinely per-view -- +140/+160/+164 come out of the frame's
// resource resolve (sub_1401F3D20), i.e. descriptor indices for TRANSIENT targets, so MAIN's
// point at memory that has been aliased to something else by the time VRCAM's pass runs.
// +168/+172 are that view's jitter and +144/+148 its resolved cloud-target size.

    // channel rather than assumed -- all six offsets dropped out of the differing list and the run
    // count fell from 36 to 24-31 -- so this is a real negative result and not an inert knob, which is
    // the distinction that cost a round earlier in the same hunt (CyberpunkVR_ProbeReuseMode).
    // The ceiling is still about 1.8x brighter in VRCAM, so whatever does that is elsewhere.
    //
    // KEPT ON anyway, at the user's call and for a good reason: the six were genuinely wrong, holding
    // constructor defaults in a view whose neighbours were all filled from the environment. Leaving a
    // known-wrong value in place because it does not happen to cause the bug being chased is how the
    // next bug gets an extra variable. Nothing regressed with it on.
    //
    // FAILURE MODE, if a later change makes one of them matter: a legitimately per-view field would
    // make the second eye wrong at a DIFFERENT distance or brightness rather than matching. Clear bit
    // 11 and bisect by splitting the group.
    //
    // AND 0x720 TURNS OUT TO FEED SCREEN-SPACE REFLECTIONS, which is where the interior defect actually
    // lives. The chain, measured end to end on frame_10255 (captured 11:51, i.e. BEFORE this bit shipped
    // at 12:03, so it still shows the unmirrored state):
    //
    //   1. a grid over the shared scene HDR target, read at the same stage in each view, peaks at 1.84x
    //      on the ceiling and sits at ~1.00 over two thirds of the frame
    //   2. pixel history on one ceiling pixel says the difference is introduced by RenderLightsIntegrate,
    //      not by the fog: VRCAM 0.0879/0.0347/0.0278 against MAIN 0.0322/0.0034/0.0059 after lighting,
    //      and the fog then adds +0.049 to BOTH
    //   3. of the sixteen textures that action reads, fifteen agree at that pixel and ONE does not:
    //      ResourceId::32983, R8_UNORM 2560x2560, VRCAM 1.0000 against MAIN 0.0157
    //   4. that mask is written by ScreenSpaceReflections (RVA 0x157B24), three dispatches in EACH view --
    //      so the second view does run the pass; it just gets a different answer
    //   5. its 372-byte constant block differs in two fields: [22].y = 4000 against 1, and
    //      [22].z = 5000 against 8. The 4000/1 pair is exactly viewData+0x720, which bit 11 now mirrors.
    //

    //
    // The measurement to compare against, from frame_10255: at the SAME stage of the same shared
    // target (right after each view's RenderFogOverlay), a grid of ratios is ~1.00 across two thirds
    // of the frame and peaks at 1.84x over x 1280..1600 y 640..960 -- the ceiling. Everything feeding
    // that region has been measured equal: the lighting integrate (9 identical bindings, same target),
    // the volumetric fog, the 160x160 atmosphere LUTs (0.975-0.979 per band), the exposure block, and
    // every fog parameter in viewData (the [fog] probe prints 0x920 as 0.00025 in BOTH views indoors,
    // which also retires the older note here claiming MAIN holds exactly 0 there).
    // 0x720 IS A PAIR, AND THE SECOND HALF IS THE HALF THAT MATTERS. Mirroring four bytes here
    // equalised 0x720 and the very next log line showed a fresh run starting at 0x724 with
    // {41000000|459C4000} -- 8.0 against 5000.0. Those two dwords are the screen-space-reflection
    // march: distance and step count. IDA confirms they are one pair rather than two fields, twice
    // over: sub_14024DE10 writes 4000.0 to [r10+0x310] and 5000.0 to [r10+0x314], and sub_1406109CC
    // writes the same two to [r8+0x48] and [r8+0x4C] -- adjacent floats, default-initialised.
    //
    // A ray march told to travel 4000 units in 5000 steps finds a hit almost everywhere, which is
    // why the second view mirrors the room in a ceiling MAIN leaves matt. Measured end to end on
    // frame_10255: the SSR mask ResourceId::32983 reads 1.0000 in VRCAM against 0.0157 in MAIN at
    // the same ceiling pixel, and RenderLightsIntegrate multiplies by it.
    // AND THE SAME TAIL MISTAKE APPLIED TO THE OTHER FIELDS, now visible because the diff prints run
    // lengths. After the four-byte mirrors landed, the log showed fresh runs immediately after them:
    //
    //     77C*1{3F08C427|3F19999A}   MAIN 0.5342   VRCAM 0.6     -- tail of the run that starts 0x778
    //     A20*2{40F57A98|41000000}   MAIN 7.6708   VRCAM 8.0     -- a pair just past 0xA10..0xA1F
    //
    // Same signature that has now paid off twice: a round number in the second view against a worked
    // one in MAIN. 0x778 therefore covers eight bytes, and 0xA20 is added as its own pair. If the log
    // then shows a run at 0x780 or 0xA28, these ranges are still short -- the length field says so
    // directly now, so size them from the log rather than extending them by guess.
    // CONFIRMED FIXED, by the same measurement that found it (tools/rdc_viewgrid.py, node
    // RenderFogOverlay, frame_10040 against frame_10255):
    //
    //     before   ceiling cells 1.74 1.84 1.65 1.43, worst 1.84x at y 640..960
    //     after    ceiling cells 0.98 .. 1.06, median across the frame 0.995
    //
    // The six cells still off by more than 15% are all in the BOTTOM row (y 2240..2560) and were
    // off there before the fix too (0.54 .. 1.11), which is parallax on the nearest geometry --
    // floor, hands, weapon -- not a per-view mismatch. 64 mm of eye separation moves a half-metre

// as distant: a2=rdx, view ctx = *(a2+0x18), key @ ctx+0x28. If vrcam loses local shadows

// the symptom better than anything else measured: some lights work for VRCAM (near stalls)
// and some never do (street lamps, the road) -- which is what a missing shadow slice looks
// like, since a shadow-casting light with no slice is dropped rather than drawn unshadowed.
// Tested before only together with the other two reuse modes, where VRCAM re-rendering every
// local shadow (30x MAIN in the audit) could break it a second way.
// Measured 2026-07-29: with this at 0 the node does dispatch for VRCAM (AD5770 leaves the
// census) and the lamps are still unlit. Not the cause; put back for the 30x it costs.
// AND TESTED AT 0 AGAIN 2026-08-18 AGAINST A SYMPTOM IT HAD NEVER BEEN TRIED ON, WITH THE SAME ANSWER:
// interior lighting differs between the eyes -- the sofa cushions and the ceiling, "shiny in VRCAM,
// normal in MAIN". Outdoors the sun dominates and this is invisible; indoors the local lights ARE the
// lighting, and this is the one lighting-relevant node the second view does not run, so it was the first
// thing to try. At 0 the artefacts are UNCHANGED (user, same scene). Local shadow reuse is not the cause
// of the interior mismatch either, and this knob is back at 1 for the 10.6x it costs.
//
// That also kills the analogy I reached for. A sun cascade is fitted to the VIEWER, which is what gave
// the two views something to disagree about; local shadow maps are per-light and world-space with a
// verified-identical light->slice mapping, so reuse here is exact by construction and there was never a
// matrix for the eyes to disagree over. Next suspect is the specular path itself -- reflection probes and
// screen-space reflections -- not the shadow atlases.
// (previous note kept below)
// AT 0 2026-08-18 for the interior symptom: interior lighting differs
// between the eyes -- the sofa cushions and the ceiling, "shiny in VRCAM, normal in MAIN". Outdoors the
// sun dominates and this is invisible; indoors the local lights ARE the lighting, and this is the one
// lighting-relevant node the second view does not run.
//
// Read the result with the note above in mind. At 0 the second view re-renders every local shadow into
// the shared atlas, which is measured at 10.6x MAIN's cycles and thrashes MAIN's temporal cache, so
// shadow flicker and a frame-time cost at 0 are EXPECTED and are not new bugs. What the test answers is
// only whether the interior specular mismatch follows this knob.
//
// And one analogy is withdrawn before it misleads: this is NOT the sun-cascade case. A cascade is fitted
// to the viewer, which is what gave the two views something to disagree about. Local shadow maps are

// --- Reflection-probe atlas reuse for VRCAM -----------------------------
// THE ONE SHARED CACHE THIS PORT NEVER GUARDED. The reuse table had GI, distant shadows, local shadow maps
// and the temporal history; env probes were not in it, and the capture says they should have been.
//
// Measured on an interior capture (18506), per view, from the port's own pass markers:
//
//     VRCAM | ReflectionProbes   37 actions: 30+ draws of 3 indices into ResourceId::26530
//                                (512x256, THIRTY-TWO array slices, R11G11B10_FLOAT -- the probe atlas)
//                                with 1x1x1 dispatches interleaved, i.e. per-probe convolution
//     MAIN  | ReflectionProbes    1 action:  a single 80x80 dispatch and two copies. No probe rendering.
//
// So the second view rebuilds the SHARED probe atlas every frame and MAIN does not -- the same shape as the
// local-shadow thrash that this file already documents: a fresh view has nothing cached, so it forces a full
// re-render into a cache MAIN relies on. Everything else in the specular path is symmetric (DrawConeAO 5/5,
// PrepareFeedbackSSRBuffer_PreSSR 21/21, ScreenSpaceReflections 5/5), which makes this the only candidate left
// for the symptom: interior lighting differs between the eyes, "shiny in VRCAM, normal in MAIN". A probe that
// has just been rasterised and not yet convolved reads as a mirror rather than a rough reflection, which is
// what "shiny" looks like.
//
// Same ABI as the distant and local skips: a2 = rdx, view ctx = *(a2+0x18), key @ ctx+0x28, and the skipped
// node returns 0 exactly as RenderLocalShadowMaps does.
//
// NOT PROVEN, and the failure mode is written down first: if the second view genuinely needs its own probes,
// its reflections go flat or stale instead of shiny, and this goes back to 0. Two earlier suspects for this
// same symptom were eliminated by measurement -- RenderLightsIntegrate (identical bindings, identical output
// statistics) and local shadow reuse (tested at 0, artefacts unchanged).
// MEASURED HARMFUL AT 1, AND KEPT AT 0. Turning it back off fixed two things the user had reported as part of
// the interior bug: the glasses on the bar went from bluish back to the same yellow MAIN shows, and the black
// patch on the sofa chairs disappeared. Both of those were MINE -- introduced by this knob, not by the port's
// stereo path -- and they were mixed into the symptom list for an hour before that came out.
//
// The mechanism is the one the capture had already shown and I armed the knob against anyway: the SECOND VIEW
// is the one that FILLS the shared reflection-probe atlas (ResourceId::26530, 512x256 x32 slices -- 30 draws
// in VRCAM's turn against none in MAIN's). Skipping its node does not make it reuse MAIN's work, because MAIN
// does no probe work; it leaves the atlas to nobody. Unconvolved or stale probe faces read as a mirror and as
// black, which is exactly what was seen. Reuse of a cache only helps when someone else fills it.
//
// A separate lesson, worth more than the knob: DO NOT TREAT AN x64dbg READ AS A MEASUREMENT WITHOUT CHECKING
// debug_get_state FIRST. DebugProbeSkipHits read as 0 with the debugger detached (state "stopped"), so the
// expression resolved against the image instead of the process, and that zero was reported as evidence. The
// log is the instrument that does not lie about this; the detour now reports itself there.
//
// The detour now reports itself into the log, which needs no debugger: entries at zero means this detour is
// not on the path at all; entries climbing with match=0 means the ABI assumption is wrong and the view
// context is not at *(a2+0x18). The view KEY itself is known good -- the sky-node probe below reads
// *(ctx+0x28) the same way and separates the views correctly thousands of times a run.

// THE FOLIAGE WIND IMPULSE -- one write, and the measurement behind it.
//
// Symptom (2026-08-17): standing in a bush made it twitch, and turning the head made all of MAIN's
// vegetation jitter while the second eye stayed perfect. The decisive datum came from the user:
// switch the SECOND view off and MAIN is correct. So MAIN was never short of data -- it was affected
// by the mere existence of the other view.
//
// THE PASS. CRenderNode_WindImpulseVolumeUpdate (sub_1406EAEDC) is the only thing that injects the
// repellers -- actors standing in vegetation, gathered by the game-side tick group the exe names
// "RepellerComponents/FoliageRepeller" -- into the volume the foliage shaders read. It decides
// whether to do anything from two gates:
//
//     windState = *(*(wc + 0x20) + 0xB0)                      // ONE object, shared by both views
//     if ((wc[0x30] & 2) == 0)                       -> skip  // not the view that owns shared work
//     if (!latch(windState + 0x1C, renderer+0x4CA4)) -> skip  // already done this frame
//
// The latch is an InterlockedExchange of the frame id, so EXACTLY ONE view per frame gets through --
// correct for a game with one view, and the whole of this bug for two. Measured in x64dbg: the body
// is entered by VRCAM (view key at ctx+0x28 non-zero) in 5433 frames out of 5791, while MAIN arrives
// with the owner bit set, finds the frame already claimed, and jumps over everything.
//
// AND THE ANSWER IS NOT WHAT THE VOLUME CONTAINS BUT WHEN IT IS WRITTEN. Each of these was built,
// measured to reach MAIN, and left the jitter exactly where it was:
//
//   * replaying the pass's 48-byte constant buffer for MAIN, captured in the uploader, same frame
//     (2987 extra runs, 2988 replays, 0 stale) -- MAIN still jittered;
//   * rebuilding those 48 bytes from the shared state instead of copying them -- and a self-check
//     against the engine's own upload showed the built block differing by exactly one scroll step,
//     because the state advances between the two dispatches. Fresh is the wrong thing to be here:
//     the volume was written with the OTHER view's numbers;
//   * replaying the pass's five resource bindings (51656 recorded, 4119 replayed);
//   * reopening the same latch on CRenderNode_AdvanceSpeedTreeWind, the global wind (4121 extra runs);
//   * running the whole pass for both views with the clock restored, the ageing suppressed and the
//     impulse records snapshotted and put back -- which made BOTH eyes twitch and cost frame rate.
//
// That last one produced the trace worth keeping. A hardware write breakpoint on the impulse count at
// windState+0x104 caught two writers:
//
//     0x6EDB36  mov  [rdi+0x0C], esi     the game ADDS an impulse (esi=1, capacity 0xFF)
//     0x6EE158  dec  [rcx+0x0C]          the pass RETIRES one, and MOVES records to close the gap
//
// so restoring the count alone re-injects a record that has been shuffled -- and restoring the bytes
// as well still twitches, because the second dispatch itself is what one shared volume cannot
// survive.
//
// WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS. The claim is taken on the CPU by whichever view's node runs first, but the two
// graphs do not reach the GPU in that order: MAIN's draws are submitted before the second view's
// dispatch, so MAIN samples the volume as of the PREVIOUS frame. Correct data, one frame old --
// invisible standing still, and exactly a jitter while the head turns. Switching the second view off
// makes MAIN claim the latch itself, which puts its dispatch ahead of its own draws, which is why
// that looked right.
//
// THE FIX is to hand the claim to MAIN: deny it to the second view by pre-claiming the frame, grant it
// to MAIN by rewinding one. One update per frame, no second dispatch, no frame-rate cost, and the view
// that draws later reads the same fresh volume. Confirmed by the user: no difference between the eyes.

// THE OTHER WIND -- and the one that actually moves the vegetation.
//
// Everything above concerns the IMPULSE volume: the local push of an actor standing in a bush. It is
// now measured not to be the twitch: MAIN received the engine's own same-frame constant block every
// frame (2987 extra runs, 2988 replays, 0 stale) and still twitched on head turns. So that thread is
// closed, and the symptom -- ALL of MAIN's grass, not just the bush the player stands in -- points at
// the global wind instead.
//
// CRenderNode_AdvanceSpeedTreeWind (sub_140CC4DF4) is three lines and both of this project's usual
// suspects are in them:
//
//     if ((wc[0x30] & 2) != 0)                          // the owner bit
//         return sub_140200B4C(*(*(wc + 0x20) + 0x80));  // the SpeedTree wind manager
//   and inside:
//     if (latch(mgr + 0x48, renderer + 0x4CA4))          // the same once-per-frame latch
//         for each wind instance: push the current wind, then sub_1401F088C(idx, 416, inst + 0x4538)
//
// So one view per frame uploads 416 bytes of wind state and the other view's vegetation is left with
// whatever was last bound to it -- stale, which is what "the grass freezes when I turn my head" is.
//
// AND THIS ONE IS SAFE TO RUN TWICE, which is the whole difference from the impulse pass. It
// accumulates nothing and consumes nothing: the values come from the manager (`v4+2848` scaled, and
// the three dwords at `v4+2864..2872`), are written into each instance and uploaded. Run it again in
// the same frame with the same inputs and it writes the same bytes. So the fix is only to reopen the
// latch for the second view -- no snapshot, no restore, nothing held.
//
// AND 2026-08-17 GAVE IT A SECOND, SHARPER REASON: the shadows cast by fences, plants and trees differ
// between the eyes, while solid objects' shadows match -- so whatever it is acts only on geometry that
// MOVES. The cascade pixel shader's three discards are all eliminated by measurement (the LOD-fade phase
// reads 0 in both views with one distinct value seen; forcing the blue-noise slice to a constant in
// every frame-constants block changed nothing; neutralising the height-mask test changed nothing), and
// the cascade VERTEX shader sways foliage in the shadow pass itself out of b8 -- a wind-texture scroll
// at b8[4].xy, a phase at b8[5].w. b8 is 26 float4 = 416 bytes, exactly what this pass uploads, and the
// census names the owner: AdvanceSpeedTreeWind, 29638 uploads for MAIN and ZERO for the second view.
//
// One buffer, written once per frame, read by two graphs at different times. The second view's graph
// runs FIRST (measured: its passes at capture event 12909, MAIN's at 40420), so every frame goes
//
//     second view's cascades   read the buffer as it stands  -> wind(N-1)
//     AdvanceSpeedTreeWind     writes it                     -> wind(N)
//     MAIN's cascades          read it                       -> wind(N)
//
// and the second eye's shadow map holds its foliage one wind step behind its own image. Invisible on
// anything rigid, unmistakable on leaves. Reopening the latch puts the upload in the second view's graph
// too, ahead of its cascades.
//
// Recorded because it nearly cost the finding: this latch was reopened once before, during the bush
// jitter hunt, and "changed nothing" -- true of THAT symptom, and the shadows were not being looked at.
// A knob measured innocent of one fault is not innocent of the next.
// THE WIND IS BACK IN THE FRAME, and my earlier reading of these counters was wrong. From
// First = 8441, ExtraMain = 5870, ExtraVrcam = 0 I concluded "the second view claims the wind, so both
// eyes read the same one". That skipped the fact this hunt had already established elsewhere: the
// renderer's frame id ADVANCES BETWEEN THE TWO VIEWS' PASSES. The latch compares against that id, so each
// view sees it as a new frame and each claims the wind for itself:
//
//     second view's frame:  latch = its id     -> uploads wind(N)
//     MAIN's frame:         id has moved on    -> claims it too, uploads wind(N+1)
//
// so the grass in the two shadow maps sways one wind step apart. 8441 claims in an interval is TWO per
// eye-pair, not one. And it fits what the user sees now: with everything else settled the cable's shadow
// (rigid) matches, while grass (wind-animated) still differs.
//
//   mode 0  the engine's own behaviour: each view advances the wind in its own frame
//   mode 1  reopen the latch for the view that finds it claimed (idempotent, but pointless -- it just
//           re-uploads the same values)
//   mode 2  DENY the second view the claim, so one wind state serves the pair
//
// Default 0 deliberately: mode 2 is the candidate and it is switched on live, one variable at a time,
// because testing it together with the block change above would be two changes and no measurement.

// ================================================================================================
// THE CASCADE'S OWN MATRIX, keyed by cascade index -- the last unverified assumption.
//
// The thin-shadow report (a cable on a building differs between the eyes) overturned my own reason for
// excluding the cascade transform. I had argued that a placement difference would move EVERY shadow;
// that is wrong. A cascade texel is a few centimetres and the eyes are 6.5 cm apart, so an offset of a
// texel is invisible on a building's broad shadow and decisive on anything thinner than a few texels:
// a cable, a fence slat, a branch. Which is exactly the set of objects reported.
//
// What IS verified, live in the debugger: the two views' cascade passes reach the same scene manager --
// *(view_ctx + 0x1E10) reads 0x2A926A675C0 for both -- so the cascade records are one shared object, not
// one per view. But a shared pointer is not a shared VALUE at draw time: this project's own notes record
// the pattern of two views rebuilding one global in turn, and if each view writes its placement before
// its own pass, both read "their own" matrix out of the same memory.
//
// So the matrix has to be compared AT THE MOMENT EACH VIEW DRAWS, and keyed by cascade index -- the
// mistake that wasted three measurements today was keying too coarsely, and the cascade node uploads its
// 848-byte block two dozen times a frame. The index is taken from the node argument the pass itself uses
// (a1 + 24, the same read as `v12 = *(unsigned int *)(a1 + 24)`) and published in a thread-local for the
// upload probe to key on.
// AND THE FIELD THAT MAKES THEM DIFFER, found in the pass's own body after the plugin captured the call
// stack at the upload (engine frames 1E37E3 153A6C 1EC46D ... -- 153A6C is inside this very node, so the
// constants are built here rather than by a separate setup):
//
//     sub_14028DB28(v51, v13 + 801616);     // v51 = local cascade constants, from the SHARED record
//     v20 = *(float *)(v14 + 2664);         // v14 = viewData + 16 * cascade_idx  -> PER VIEW
//     v52 = v52 - v20;                      // two fields of the constants, adjusted by it
//     v53 = v53 - v20;
//     sub_1401E2C94(a2, (__int64)v51, ...); // uploaded
//
// So the cascade record itself is shared -- the pointer was verified identical live -- and what splits
// the two eyes is one float per cascade taken from each view's own viewData (the getter is sub_1401ED930,
// which this port already calls elsewhere). Equalising THAT is the fix, and it has to be done in the
// viewData rather than in the upload: the lighting pass samples with the matrix its view rendered with,
// which is why lending MAIN's matrix to the second view's upload made grass slide with head turns.
//
// Not restored afterwards, deliberately: the value must still read as MAIN's when the sampling side comes
// to it later in the frame. Each view has its own viewData, so writing the second view's cannot disturb
// MAIN, and the engine recomputes it next frame.
// Stays ON: it only publishes the cascade index in a thread-local, which costs one store per cascade
// node and is what any further work on this will need to key by.

// ---- THE CASCADE RECORD, and which of its fields split the eyes ----------------------------------
//
// The viewData field above was a dead end: it reads 0.060000 in BOTH views, so it is a shared constant
// (a depth bias) and never lent anything. What actually differs was found by dumping the record itself at
// each view's pass -- scene_mgr + 801616 + 1104 * cascade_idx, the block the pass copies its constants
// from, at the shared pointer verified live:
//
//     +0x10  orientation quaternion            IDENTICAL in both views (the sun direction is shared)
//     +0x40  two floats, the cascade extent    VRCAM -18.0587 / 18.0587   MAIN -18.0586 / 18.0586
//     +0x80  three floats, the cascade CENTRE  VRCAM (-1959.021, -363.2735, -1442.0868)
//                                              MAIN  (-1958.997, -363.2810, -1442.1367)
//
// THOSE OFFSETS ARE 0x40 AND 0x80, and the first attempt wrote 0x50 and 0x90 -- I had misread the first
// dump by one sixteen-byte row. At 0x50 and 0x90 sit direction vectors, so the "fix" handed each view the
// other's directions, and the bushes' shadows swung with the head. Re-read row by row against a fresh
// dump before believing an offset; the failure was arithmetic, not the approach.
//
// AND THEN THE IN-FRAME PROBE RETRACTED ALL OF IT. Those numbers above came from TWO DEBUGGER STOPS, in
// different frames, and in VR the head never holds still -- so they are a measurement of head jitter, not
// of the two views. Running the same comparison inside one frame, from the detour, reports:
//
//     [cascrec] cascade 1 record, dwords differing between the views (0): (none)
//
// zero differing dwords across the whole 1104-byte record, repeatedly. The record is SHARED and IDENTICAL:
// both eyes place the cascade the same way, and the "5 cm centre offset" never existed. The two failed
// lends (this one and the deleted CascMatFix) were therefore fixing nothing and breaking the render/sample
// agreement of whichever view received the copy.
//
// The rule this cost: a cross-frame comparison cannot answer a per-view question. Two breakpoint hits are
// two different frames. Only a probe that holds both views' copies from ONE frame may be believed -- and
// that is also how the same trap was caught with the 480-byte block earlier the same day.
//
// AND THE "RECORD IDENTICAL" READING IS NOW RETRACTED FOR THE SECOND TIME, by a probe that measures instead
// of asking yes/no. With the head turning, the two views fit cascade centres 9-13 cm apart on cascade 0 and
// 21-36 cm apart on cascade 1 -- five to seven texels and more, in one frame. Standing still they agree,
// which is why a boolean taken at rest said "identical" and why the user's "only when I turn my head" was the
// observation that broke the case open.
//
// Both eyes write that one shared atlas from boxes up to a third of a metre apart, so their content is
// quantised on grids several texels offset. A shadow one or two texels wide lands on a different texel in
// each eye (grass), and along a view ray in the volumetric fog the offset accumulates into a visible
// horizontal displacement, opposite in the two eyes (the blocky sun shafts in the hospital-bed ending, which
// the user reports as far more visible than the grass -- same defect, amplified by the ray).
//
// ON, with the fit copied whole. This is the first version aimed at the measured cause rather than at a
// guess, and CyberpunkVR_CascFitProbe is the check: if the lend works, maxCentre must fall to zero.
//
// AND THE WARNING TWENTY LINES UP CAME TRUE, WHICH IS WHY THIS LEND NEEDS A PARTNER. "Breaking the
// render/sample agreement of whichever view received the copy" is exactly what the user then reported:
// shadows blinking in MAIN, clean in the second view -- MAIN being the view that receives the copy. A capture
// measured the broken half directly: MAIN rasterises with the second view's fit (this lend, [cascfit]
// after=0.0000 m) and still SAMPLES with a matrix built from its own camera, and the two disagree by 58.1 mm
// along the light -- the 0.0640 m eye separation projected onto the sun direction, reproduced to 0.3 mm in two
// independent captures.
//
// The sampling matrix is not in this record, which is why zeroing the record's difference could never fix it:
// it lives in the 928-byte CSConstants block the frame graph uploads at PrepareSceneRendering.
// CyberpunkVR_CascSampleLend in Grading.cpp lends it in the same direction as this one. The two belong

// The user's observation is what this exists for, and it is the sharpest evidence of the day: with the reuse
// armed, the shadows are CORRECT while the head is still and wrong the moment the head TURNS. Translation
// does not do it; rotation does. A sun cascade is fitted to the viewer -- centre roughly position plus
// forward times half the range -- so orientation moves the centre by metres where position moves it by
// centimetres. Cascade 0's extent is +-18 world units, a 36 m box over maybe 2048 texels, i.e. ~1.8 cm per
// texel: a couple of degrees of head turn is hundreds of texels.
//
// So the two views do NOT fit the same cascade whenever the head is moving, and reuse fails for that reason
// alone -- no barrier, no ordering, no second texture required to explain it.
//
// AND THE EARLIER "0 differing dwords" HAS TO BE RE-READ IN THAT LIGHT. It was a yes/no over the record
// bytes, taken while standing still, and it answered "are they ever different" with the head not moving.
// This reports the MAGNITUDE instead, and its maximum over the interval, so head motion cannot hide inside a
// boolean. If the centres separate by centimetres or more while turning, the same mechanism is a candidate

// previous frame while using this frame's matrix.
//
// That failure also settled a question the flag comment only implied: the eye that skipped its build still
// HAD shadows -- wrong ones, not missing ones -- so the cascade atlas is one shared resource, not a texture
// per graph. Which means reuse works in the other direction with no staleness at all: let the second view
// (first to run) build the atlas, and skip the build for MAIN, which runs after it in the same frame. The
// in-frame record probe already showed the cascade record is identical at both passes, so MAIN's sampling
// matrix matches what the second view rasterised.
//
// Both nodes have to go for MAIN, not just the render: ClearShadowCascades would otherwise wipe the atlas

// Default 0. It is a single dword, so it can be armed live in the debugger without a rebuild, and its whole

// identical, and that is the foliage mismatch. If nothing changes, the atlases agree and the mismatch is

// reads a texture whose state the graph believes to be something else.
//
// The depth-target probe says the saving is real and worth having: both views bind the SAME atlas
// descriptor per cascade (casc0/casc1 identical for MAIN and the second view) from an identical cascade
// record, so one of the two rasterisations is a pure duplicate -- roughly 47000 draws and 134000 instances
// a frame.
//
// So take the work and leave the structure:
//   * ClearShadowCascades: skipped at the NODE for MAIN, so the atlas the second view just filled survives.
//     The pass itself stays in the graph, so its edges and its ordering do not move.
//   * RenderShadowCascade: RUNS for MAIN -- every bind and transition it performs still happens -- and only
//     its DRAWS are suppressed, at the command list.
//
// The two knobs are deliberately separate: SkipMain is the measured-harmful version and stays at 0 as the
// record of what not to do; SaveMain is the version that keeps the barriers.
//
// AND IT FAILED IDENTICALLY -- "артефакты у main, мерцания, то же самое и при 50 бите" -- which is the most
// useful result of the three, because it eliminates the explanation I had built the knob on. The node ran,
// every bind and transition it declares happened, and the picture broke exactly as it did when the node was
// cut outright. So the barriers were never what was missing.
//
// THREE VARIANTS, AND THE USER CORRECTED ME ON THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL: it is ONE artefact, not three.
// I had written them up as "slides", "twitches" and "flickers" as though the failure modes differed and
// each pointed somewhere; they do not. Same artefact every time, which means one mechanism, and my three
// separate diagnoses were three inventions.
//
//   bit 50 on the second view   its graph emits no cascade passes at all
//   both nodes cut for MAIN     work and structure both gone
//   clear node kept, only the clear command and the draws dropped
//
// AND THE ONE MECHANISM IS HEAD ROTATION. With reuse armed the shadows are CORRECT while the head is still,
// and wrong the instant it turns -- the user's own test, and worth more than everything above. A sun cascade
// is fitted to the viewer, so orientation moves its centre by metres while position moves it by centimetres;
// cascade 0 covers a 36 m box, so a degree or two of turn is hundreds of texels. The eye that skips its own
// rasterisation therefore samples an atlas fitted to the pose of the OTHER view's pass, and those two poses
// are sampled milliseconds apart. Nothing about barriers, ordering or resource identity is required to
// explain any of the three failures.
//
// See CyberpunkVR_CascFitProbe above: it measures that separation in metres instead of asserting it, and if
// it is large while turning then the same mechanism is a candidate for the eye-difference itself.
//
// AND THE CAPTURE FOUND WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG WITH IT, which was neither ordering nor the barriers the
// knob was built to protect. Reading the cascade lists' barriers with their STATES:
//
//     ClearShadowCascades  Resource_5159   NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE -> DEPTH_WRITE      <- both runs
//     RenderCascade0/1     Resource_48841  COPY_DEST <-> VERTEX_AND_CONSTANT_BUFFER      <- run 0 only
//     RenderCascade0/1     Resource_4843   COPY_DEST <-> VERTEX_AND_CONSTANT_BUFFER      <- run 1 only
//
// The atlas is Resource_5159, ONE depth texture, barriered by both views. The two resources that differ are
// buffers -- their states say so -- i.e. each view's own constant/instance stream, nothing to do with the
// atlas. (I read that table wrong once and told the user there were two atlases; the states are what settle
// it, and they were in the same rows all along.)
//
// So the atlas IS shared, the second rasterisation IS redundant, and the reason this knob flickered is that
// it cut the ClearShadowCascades NODE -- taking with it the very transition above. MAIN then bound and
// sampled the atlas in a state the graph believed to be something else. The node cut and the "keep the
// barriers" variant failed identically because both removed that transition.
//
// SaveMain now withholds only the ClearDepthStencilView COMMAND, in hk_ClearDepthStencilView: the node runs,
// the transition happens, the depth the second view wrote this frame is what MAIN samples. SkipMain stays at
// 0 as the record of the cruder version.
//
// THE DUPLICATE IS REAL, AND HERE IS HOW IT WAS FINALLY LABELLED. Each view rasterises its own cascade block
// immediately before its own colour work, and a capture proves it WITHOUT markers, by reading whose camera is
// bound (CameraShaderConsts float 144), because the two eyes sit 0.0640 m apart in world X:
//
//     6061..6305    98 draws, camera buffer 3032    (546.0938, -2378.1738, 0)     cascade block 1
//     9000..12000   colour work, buffer 313090      (546.1180, -2378.1675, 174.8) view A
//     23772..23947  56 draws, camera buffer 3032    (546.0938, -2378.1738, 0)     cascade block 2
//     26000..30000  colour work, buffer 31650       (546.1820, -2378.1675, 174.8) view B
//
// 546.1820 - 546.1180 = 0.0640 m. Two views, each with its own camera buffer, each preceded by its own cascade
// block. So MAIN's pass IS a duplicate and withholding it saves real work -- measured live at 286 draws and one
// clear per frame, with the picture correct.
//
// AN EARLIER READING HERE WAS WRONG AND IS RETRACTED. Single frames showed one cascade block, or none, or two:
// the atlas update is SCHEDULED, so three consecutive frames gave 2, 0 (a copy instead) and 1 block. Counting
// blocks in one frame cannot establish who rasterises anything, which is how "the engine already does it once"
// got written down. The reading it replaced said:
//
//     23735..23879   forty depth-only DrawIndexedInstanced into the cascade target, ONE contiguous block,
//                    in the gap between the two views' graphs and immediately before MAIN's
//     234655         the atlas both masks sample -- FOUR usages in the whole frame, every one a READ
//                    (11447 and 15699 for one eye, 29723 and 34188 for the other), no write, no copy
//     and there is no second candidate: two 2048^2 R16 textures in the capture and no D16 texture at all
//
// The earlier capture agrees from the other side: of its nine ClearDepthStencilView events, eight came in
// per-eye pairs and exactly ONE was unpaired -- the cascade clear. (That pairing argument is also void for the
// same reason: it counted one frame.)
//
// AND NOTE WHY THE CAPTURE STILL SHOWS MAIN'S BLOCK WITH THIS KNOB ON. Our command-list hooks sit BELOW
// RenderDoc's wrapper: the game calls the wrapper, RenderDoc serialises the draw, and only then does our hook
// on the real list drop it. A capture therefore records what the GAME asked for, never what the GPU received --
// so nothing this knob does can be judged from a capture. The counters are the instrument.
//
// So "both views bind the same atlas from an identical record, therefore one of the two rasterisations is a
// pure duplicate" was reading two NODE invocations as two rasterisations. The node runs per view; the drawing
// happens once.
//
// ARMED AGAIN ANYWAY, ON THE USER'S POINT, WHICH IS THE BEST ARGUMENT IN THIS WHOLE FILE. Every failure above
// was diagnosed BEFORE the cascade camera was known to differ between the views. Each attempt changed who
// rasterises the atlas while leaving the camera and the sampling matrix per-view -- so every one of them could
// have been failing for the reason the three lends have now fixed, and "reuse is impossible" was never
// established, only assumed from the wreckage.
//
// This knob is the test, and it is worth running because the two outcomes say opposite things:
//
//   the picture stays correct -> the single rasterisation I measured is NOT the whole story; the second view's
//                               graph draws the cascades too, the duplicate is real, and reuse is available
//                               together with whatever the pass costs in a dense scene
//   the shadows break again   -> the pass really is single and lives in MAIN's graph, so dropping MAIN's draws
//                               removes the only rasterisation there is. That also explains every earlier
//                               failure without appealing to barriers, ordering or resource identity
//
// Either way it is one launch for an answer that three earlier rounds argued about. Failure mode, written down
// first: sun shadows wrong or missing in one eye, image geometry untouched. Set to 0 to revert.
//
// LIVE, as xr_cascade_save_main in vrport.ini -- 1 keeps the fix, 0 lets MAIN clear the shared
// atlas again (vanilla behaviour, duplicate rasterisation and all). It reads on the next poll,
// so the revert above no longer needs a debugger.

// ---- FINDING THE COMMAND LIST THE ENGINE HOLDS ---------------------------------------------------
//
// The port's PIX markers are emitted 198038 times a run and appear in a RenderDoc capture exactly zero times.
// Both numbers are measured, and together they say where we sit: our command-list vtable hook is on the REAL
// D3D12Core list (distinctVtables=1, found through our own creation path), while the game records into
// RenderDoc's WRAPPER. Anything we call on the real list is below the capture layer and is recorded by nobody.
//
// So the marker has to go to the object the ENGINE holds, and this probe finds it by the one signature that
// cannot be mistaken: a pointer inside the node's work context whose VTABLE lies inside renderdoc.dll. Nothing
// else in this process has that shape. With a capture layer absent it reports d3d12core vtables instead, which
// is the same slot and is how the offset is confirmed without a capture running.
//
// Every dereference is guarded by VirtualQuery rather than by __try, deliberately: this project has already
// established that the engine's own VEH swallows SEH first, so a bad read crashes the game even inside a
// __try. Asking the OS whether a page is committed and readable is the only guard that actually holds.

// ================================================================================================
// MORE OF THE SAME FAMILY, moved out of the monolith: the amortised sky, the GI reuse mode, and the
// lending of MAIN's draw-block list to the light-volume pass.
//
// All three are the rule at the top of this file applied again -- an expensive producer runs once and
// the second view reads its result. The sky is the one that fights back: it is amortised across frames,
// so the second view asking for it mid-amortisation is not free, and the mode knob exists because the
// right answer depended on measurement rather than principle.
// ================================================================================================

// ---- the amortised sky, and the second view fighting MAIN for it ---------------------------
//
// PROVEN, not inferred. sub_1407818F8 (the body of CRenderNode_RenderSkyScattering) builds the
// sky in SIX INSTALMENTS into a 32-byte record picked by `32 * *(BYTE*)(view + 0x16E0)`:
//
//     v15 = *(BYTE*)(rec + 80);                  // the shared slot cursor
//     do { v16 = 1 << v15++; v17 = v14 & v16; } while (!v17);
//     *(BYTE*)(rec + 80) = v15;                  // ADVANCE IT
//     sub_140783384(a2, v17, ...);               // fill that slot FROM THIS VIEW
//     if (*(BYTE*)(rec + 80) >= 6) { publish; slot = 0; InterlockedExchange(rec+72, 0); }
//
// and the live probe says both views index the SAME record:
//     [sky] sky-record index view+0x16E0 -- MAIN 0  VRCAM 0     AA mode -- MAIN 0  VRCAM 0
//
// AA mode 0 on both means `!v4` holds for both, so both views pass the gate and both advance one
// cursor. The published sky is therefore assembled from alternating instalments of two different
// cameras -- MAIN fills slot 0, VRCAM slot 1, MAIN slot 2, and so on -- and it reaches six in
// half the frames, so it republishes twice as often, each time half-wrong. Which view lands on
// which slot drifts, so the result changes shape from frame to frame. At night that LUT is what
// carries the stars and the horizon, which is exactly the reported "no stars, the sky is not
// like that". The enabled-slot mask itself is per view too (`v14 = v28 ? -1 : -17`, and v28 is
// sub_140B2CB98(a2, ...)), so the two are not even filling the same set.
//
// The remedy is the one distant shadows and local shadow maps both needed, for the same reason:
// let ONE view drive the shared structure and have the other consume the published result. The
// sky LUT is a function of sun direction and altitude, not of view direction, so MAIN's answer
// is correct for an eye 6.5 cm away -- the same argument that makes cascade and GI reuse sound.
//
// 1 = skip the sky build for the second view (it samples MAIN's published sky).
// 0 = both views build it, i.e. the shipped behaviour, for A/B.

// Both views build the SHARED committed GI cache Resource_122 (10243 R11G11B10) -> redundant.
// Goal: vrcam should REUSE main's 122 (skip its build) but STILL apply, AND keep GIVolumes.
// Two dead ends: (1) hooking update fn sub_14077F758 -> CRASH (apply got garbage a2, minidump:
// sub_14077E74C+0x24). (2) clearing bit31 (VrcamFlagMode=3) skipped update cleanly BUT bit31
// also gates RenderGIVolumes (sub_140B779DC = interior light) -> interior went dark.
// SOLUTION: hook the GI NODE and, for vrcam, REPLICATE its flow minus the update+dirty-refresh
// (both write the shared mgr/122; main maintains them). Full control of a2 (no corruption),
// ctx bit31 untouched (GIVolumes, a SEPARATE node, still runs), apply reuses main's 122.
// RVAs verified from live disasm @ base 0x7FF6EF660000.

// DEFAULT 0 since 2026-07-28. A night capture (Objects/EventList_LATESTVR) shows MAIN running
// a lighting stage VRCAM does not: PSO 1030 (5424 + 4166 groups), 671 (1943 + 1636), 1316
// (16^3) and 1336 x16 over 3D grids, writing the shared GI cache Resource_122 (1024x1024x3
// R11G11B10), the 64^3 clipmap volumes Resource_3164/3166 and a 112 MB probe buffer. That is
// this hook skipping the GI build for VRCAM, and the audit agrees: GlobalIllumination is
// MAIN 0.1022 ms vs VRCAM 0.0289 ms. The reuse was measured as harmless earlier -- but in
// DAYLIGHT, where the stage is inert; at night it is what lights the street lamps.
// BACK TO 1 (2026-07-31). The 0 above was set on 2026-07-28 for the night street lamps, and
// that theory is recorded as DISPROVEN in the same hunt: all three reuse knobs off changed
// nothing for the lamps, which were finally fixed by RenderMask/DistantLights instead. What
// the 0 did keep doing is let VRCAM rebuild the SHARED GI every frame from its own frustum --
// cache Resource_122, the 64^3 clipmaps 3164/3166, the 112 MB probe buffer -- and the note at
// GI_FEATURE_BIT says exactly what that costs: "main GI (ambient light/shadows) flicker".
// It is also the ONLY reuse knob that differs from the known-good testbed snapshot of 25 Jul.
// AT 0 FOR AN INTERIOR TEST 2026-08-18, and the standing warning above is exactly why this is a test and
// not a change. The pipeline sweep says the two views do not merely run this node a different number of
// times, they run DIFFERENT compute shaders inside it: VRCAM 3 actions (cs 1911, 2574, 2058) against
// MAIN 28 (cs 2058, 2058, 1174). So reuse here is not "the same apply over reused data", it is another
// branch -- and indoors the indirect light IS the lighting, which is the reported symptom: ceiling too
// shiny, glasses lit cold instead of warm like the room, blown highlights, haze wrong. The flicker
// verdict that pinned this knob at 1 was measured OUTDOORS; indoors it was never tried.
//
// EXPECTED COST AT 0, from the record above: position-dependent shadow flicker, two shadow sets
// alternating in one spot and clean in others, because the second view rebuilds a shared structure from
// its own frustum. If that appears it is the price of the test, not a new defect. Back to 1 either way
// unless the interior mismatch follows this knob.
// AND THE INTERIOR A/B CAME BACK NEGATIVE, TWICE OVER (user, 2026-08-18). At 0 the ceiling and the rest of
// the interior artefacts were UNCHANGED, so GI reuse is not the cause; and the one thing that did change
// got WORSE -- the glasses went from bluish to outright white, i.e. the second view building its own GI is
// further from MAIN than reusing MAIN's. The predicted price also arrived on cue: shadows started
// flickering, which is the position-dependent flicker this file already records against this knob and is
// what confirms the knob really took effect rather than sitting inert.
//
// So the different compute shaders in this node (VRCAM cs 1911/2574/2058 against MAIN cs 2058/2058/1174)
// are a real pipeline difference and still NOT the interior defect. Back at 1, and do not spend another

// per-view frustum descriptor (sub_1401EC7EC) and submits cull JOBS -- "DoCull_MainScene"

// cull work writes visibility into the SCENE MANAGER at *(view_ctx+0x1E10), which is
// VERIFIED shared (identical ptr) between vrcam & main; occluders are gathered WORLD-SPACE.
// STEP 1 (this): skip vrcam's DoCulling entirely. If the shared manager makes vrcam's render
// reuse main's visible set -> near-free reuse (then expand main's frustum a touch to cover
// vrcam conservatively). If vrcam goes empty -> visible set is per-view-indexed -> redirect
// explicitly. Toggle LIVE via x64dbg (default OFF); watch fps + vrcam image. a2=view arg,
