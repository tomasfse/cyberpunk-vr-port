// Capture -- finding the second view's finished image, and knowing what state it rests in.
//
// Everything downstream depends on this file being right: the mirror window, the OpenXR eye submit and
// the HUD composite all read what it identifies. And the failure mode is never an error -- it is a
// black frame, or the wrong texture, or a frame from two frames ago.
//
// THE IDENTIFICATION IS BY DESCRIPTOR AND BINDING, NEVER BY REMEMBERED POINTER. The engine reallocates
// its transients, so the same address names different surfaces across a graph rebuild. Hence the RTV
// maps here -- handle to resource, handle to dimensions, and a candidate ring; hence
// mirror_publish_output rejecting a candidate for four separate reasons and counting each; and hence
// the pinned and FOREIGN sets, which say "this resource is ours, never treat it as an engine target".
//
// WHY hk_ResourceBarrier IS IN THIS FILE. Copying from a resource in the wrong state gives BLACK, with
// no error from D3D12 and nothing in the log. The barrier hook tracks the state each resource actually
// rests in, so a copy can be issued from where the resource really is rather than where we assumed it
// would be. That is the same job as the identification above, one level down, which is why the two
// live together even though one is a vtable hook and the other is a set of maps.
//
// The vrcam DynamicTexture rests in PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE, not RENDER_TARGET. The note inside the
// moved block records both the value and the symptom of getting it wrong, because that fact was paid
// for rather than read.

    //     predicate also gates REGISTRATION, so when the live read came back 1x5 every 1x5 RGBA8
    //     target in the engine became a vrcam-output candidate. Forty a second poured into the
    //     512-slot table, the cursor wrapped, the one entry that mattered was evicted, and the
    //     second eye went mono -- the symptom it was written to cure.
    //   * The read itself killed the process. A frame-graph rebuild frees the component, so
    //     CyberpunkVR_DebugRttComp dangles; +0x1E8 then holds allocator debris, and following it
    //     landed on a non-canonical address. That is the 0xC0000005-at-FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF dump, and
    //     the 1x5 was the same debris on a luckier frame.

    // So it is gone rather than patched. A guess that has to be sanity-checked against garbage it
    // should not be reading is not a fallback. If a rebuild ever does move the RTT for real, the

// ---- IS THE SUN-CASCADE ATLAS ONE TEXTURE FOR BOTH EYES? -----------------------------------------
//
// Asked because two attempts to make one eye reuse the other's cascades both failed, in opposite
// directions, and because the answer decides whether "hand the shadows from MAIN to the second view" is a
// fix or a contradiction:
//
//   * one texture  -> both eyes already rasterise into it, from a cascade record the in-frame probe shows
//                     identical, so they already sample the SAME shadow map. There is nothing to hand over
//                     and the map cannot be the source of the eye difference at all.
//   * two textures -> reuse would mean something, and the two maps' CONTENT becomes worth suspecting even
//                     though their inputs are measured identical.
//
// Everything said about this so far has been inference from the port's own comments ("reference the existing
// cascade atlas") and from how the failures looked. This measures it: the cascade pass binds a depth target,
// so the DSV descriptor it binds is recorded per view and per cascade index.
//
// MEASURED: identical, both cascades, both views -- casc0 M=197E7A25A60 V=197E7A25A60, casc1 ...A68 for
// both. (One earlier report showed casc1 differing; that was a transition, MAIN's handle coming from another
// part of the heap, and by the settled report both agreed.)
//
// AND THE CLAIM I DREW FROM IT WAS TOO STRONG, so it is corrected here rather than left standing: equal CPU
// descriptor handles prove the same descriptor SLOT, not the same resource. The engine is free to rewrite
// that slot to point at a different texture for each graph, and this probe cannot tell the two apart --
// resolving it would need CreateDepthStencilView intercepted the way CreateRenderTargetView already is.
//
// AND THE CAPTURE SETTLED IT: ONE SLOT, TWO TEXTURES. Nsight names resources directly in barriers, and the
// two cascade runs in a frame (318 draws each, events 19604..21387 and 46338..48113) clear the very same DSV
// -- DescriptorHeap_58 @ 22, which is what this probe saw -- while barriering DIFFERENT resources:
//
//     run 0 (first view):  Resource_48841 x3   + Resource_5159 x1
//     run 1 (second run):  Resource_4843  x3   + Resource_5159 x1
//
// So the engine rewrites that descriptor per graph and each view rasterises into its OWN atlas. There was
// never anything shared to hand over, which is exactly why all three reuse attempts produced artefacts (see
// CyberpunkVR_CascadeSaveMain in ViewReuse.cpp): each one made a view sample a texture that nothing in its
// own graph had written.
//
// The CONTENT of the two is still duplicated -- identical record, identical casters -- so the work is
// redundant even though the texture is not shared. Saving it would mean copying one atlas into the other, or
// repointing the sampling descriptor, not skipping a pass.
//
// Default 0: it has answered, and its answer needed the capture to be read correctly.
