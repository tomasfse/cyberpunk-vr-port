// ================================================================================================
// WHY CLOTH FLAGS STAND STILL IN THE SECOND EYE -- the second view's clock is zero.
//
// Reported 2026-08-17: the fabric flags on buildings wave in MAIN and hang dead in the second eye.
//
// THERE IS NO CLOTH SIMULATION IN THEM. The flags' pipeline state was identified from an Nsight
// capture (PipelineState_55927: one draw per view in GBuffer_Discard, 11847 indices, the SAME vertex
// and index buffers for both views), and its VERTEX shader does the waving itself:
//
//     phase  = frac(((b0[0].z * b4[2].x) / b4[1].z) + ... + sin(b0[0].z * ...))   // b0[0].z is TIME
//     wind   = sqrt(b0[9].x^2 + b0[9].y^2), normalised, dotted with INSTANCE_TRANSFORM
//     offset = sway texture sampled at (row, phase), scaled by b4[4].x * windResponse
//     pos    = POSITION * b5[4] + b5[5] + offset
//
// so the motion is a function of two things only: the TIME in the frame-constants block and the wind
// vector beside it. Nothing is skinned, nothing is simulated, and every search for a lost deformation
// was looking for data that does not exist -- which is why the instance-skinning buffer, the
// skinning/tangent node (frozen outright, its dispatch counter flat at 19940), the render mask (the
// second view has all 27 categories), LOD substitution (identical draw shapes and buffers) and the
// foliage-wind claim all came back clean.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT. Both views upload that 480-byte block once per frame from the same node, so the
// two can be compared field by field. Of its 120 floats, exactly three advance for MAIN and never
// change for the second view, whose copies are all zero -- and the control direction, fields that move
// only for the second view, was EMPTY:
//
//     [0].z  M=133150.22  V=0     the clock in seconds; THE field the cloth VS takes its phase from
//     [1].z  M=133150.19  V=0     the same clock as of the previous frame (~31 ms behind)
//     [1].w  M=0.1850     V=0     a slow clock, ~1e-4 per second: the day fraction
//
// The wind vector is identical in both views, so it was never the problem. Time in the second eye
// stands at zero for EVERYTHING, not just for cloth; the flags are simply the most visible thing that
// is a function of it.
//
// (Two more floats are zero on the same side, [9].z = 172.16 and [9].w = 728.93 for MAIN, but they
// move too slowly to have earned the name "clock" -- so they are in the mask and off by default.)
//
// THE FIX lends MAIN's clock to the second view's block, into a COPY and never into the engine's
// buffer: sub_1401F088C allocates, memcpys from the caller's pointer and commits (read in the
// debugger before writing anything), so a temporary of ours is read once and engine state is not
// touched at all. Taking MAIN's latest value is at worst one frame of phase -- 31 ms on a flag.
// Verified live: the fill counter advances once per frame, and the user confirmed the flags wave.
//
// TWO INSTRUMENTS PAID FOR THIS and are gone, both too expensive to ship: a per-(node, size, view)
// census of 400/480-byte uploads, which is what named the producing node instead of guessing it, and a
// draw-shape census over every DrawIndexedInstanced. Each took a mutex on a hot path. Their two
// lessons are worth more than the code:
//
//   * a probe keyed only by SIZE is a mixture -- 480 bytes is a common block, and the first run put
//     three different render targets' dimensions in one column and called it a clock;
//   * "frozen" means nothing unless the view is uploading at all. The first run reported the second
//     view's fields as frozen when its bucket had simply stopped growing at 694 samples.
// MODE 2, added 2026-08-17 for the shadow mismatch, and it supersedes mode 1 rather than extending it.
//
// The complete diff (above) found the frame counter at [28].y differing by exactly ONE between the
// views -- MAIN 12009 against VRCAM 12010, then MAIN 12425 against VRCAM 12424 -- and the shaders take
// their dither slice from `asuint(b0[28].y) & 63`, so 41 against 42 and 9 against 8 are DIFFERENT
// slices of blue noise. Alpha-tested geometry (fences, foliage, tree crowns) therefore discards a
// different set of pixels in each eye, in the shadow cascade as much as in the GBuffer. That is the
// reported defect exactly: a piece of shadow present in one eye and missing in the other, in different
// places, flickering per pixel.
//
// NOTE WHICH WAY THE ONE GOES: sometimes the second view is ahead, sometimes MAIN is. The counter
// advances between the two views' uploads, and which of them uploads first varies frame to frame. That
// is why mode 1 -- lend MAIN's latest value to the second view -- CANNOT fix this: in the frames where
// the second view uploads first it would receive the previous frame's value and still differ by one.
// The same objection applies to the clock mode 1 was written for.
//
// So mode 2 holds ONE value per frame and gives it to BOTH views, keyed on the renderer's frame id:
// the first upload of a frame installs the values staged from MAIN's previous authored block, and every
// upload in that frame -- MAIN's own included -- ships those. Order-independent by construction, and
// the two eyes are then bit-identical in these fields. The cost is that everything driven by them is
// one frame late, uniformly: 31 ms of sway phase and one slice of noise, neither of which is visible.
//
// MODE 3, added after modes 1 and 2 both failed to change the shadows -- and added because BOTH of them
// depend on WHICH VIEW UPLOADS FIRST, so neither can prove anything about the dither hypothesis. Mode 2
// keys on the renderer frame id, and the shipped values showed that id advancing between the two views'
// uploads (MAIN shipped 11787 where it authored 11789; the second view shipped 11789) -- the engine
// counts each VIEW as a frame, so that key does not group a stereo pair at all. Mode 1 does not use the
// frame id but hands over "MAIN's latest", which is the same value only if the second view uploads
// after MAIN.
//
// So mode 3 removes the ordering question instead of arguing about it: the dither slice is forced to
// ONE CONSTANT in both views. Equality then cannot fail for a mechanical reason, which is the only way
// a negative result becomes evidence. If the eyes still differ under mode 3, the dithered alpha test in
// this block is NOT what makes them differ, and the hypothesis is dead rather than unproven.
//
// The cost while testing is a static noise pattern instead of a temporally varying one (the shaders
// index a 64-slice blue-noise array with counter & 63, and a fixed slice means TAA has nothing to
// average). That is a diagnostic setting, not a shipping one.
//
//   mode 0  off
//   mode 1  lend MAIN's latest to the second view only (the clock fix as first shipped)
//   mode 2  one value per frame for both views, keyed on the renderer frame id -- which does NOT
//           group a stereo pair, so this is mode 1 with extra steps
//   mode 3  mode 1, plus the dither slice forced to CyberpunkVR_SwayDitherConst in both views
//   mode 4  the second view gets MAIN's WHOLE block, verbatim
//   mode 5  mode 4, plus the dither slice forced to a constant in EVERY frame-constants upload,
//           whatever node made it  (default)
//
// Mode 5 exists because mode 3 could not settle the question it was built for. The cascade pixel shader
// dithers its alpha test from asuint(b0[28].y) & 63, and modes 1-3 all patch the 480-byte block uploaded
// under PrepareSceneRendering -- but WHICH INSTANCE of b0 the cascade pass binds is not known, and the
// cascade node itself uploads no 480-byte block at all (measured: zero rows). So those modes may simply
// never have reached the shader, which makes their negative results worthless.
//
// Mode 5 drops the node key for the dither pair alone: every 480-byte upload gets the same forced slice,
// in both views, so no instance can be missed. The node filter is replaced by a CONTENT filter -- the
// block must have a large clock at [0].z -- because 480 bytes is a common size and one of the other
// blocks of that size was measured carrying render-target dimensions, which must not be overwritten.
// If the eyes still differ under mode 5, the blue-noise dither is not the cause and the hypothesis is
// finally dead rather than untested.
//
// Mode 4 is the blunt form of the same doctrine, and it is blunt on purpose: no frame key, no field
// mask, nothing to pick wrong. It is bounded by the measurement rather than by hope -- of the 120
// floats only ten differ between the views at all, so copying the block wholesale changes exactly those
// ten. Two of them are the camera position and direction ([5].xyz and [6].xyz, apart by the IPD), so
// the second eye shades from MAIN's camera; at 1.3 cm that is not something an eye can find, and if it
// ever is, the masked modes above are still there.
// Back to 4: mode 5 forced the dither slice to a constant everywhere, which was a diagnostic and is
// measured innocent -- and a constant slice means static noise, which is worse than the defect it was
// testing for. Mode 4 keeps the clocks mirrored, which is what the cloth flags need.
// MODE 1, narrowed back to what was actually confirmed working on the cloth flags: MAIN's clock lent
// to the second view. Mode 4 copies the whole block, camera position included, and was never verified
// as necessary -- shipping the broader change on the strength of an unrelated hunt would be guessing.
// Mode 4 at the user's request: the second view gets MAIN's whole frame-constants block. Worth
// knowing which lever is which -- the cable's shadow stopped differing in the same build where this
// went the other way, from 4 to 1 with the mask narrowed, so if it comes back this is the knob.

// [0].w (9) are measured to differ as well but are left out until something asks for them.
// Live-settable, so widening or narrowing it costs no rebuild.
// 0x07: the three clocks, which is the set the flags were fixed with. The dither pair (0x60) is

// ---- THE COMPLETE DIFF, because the first probe had a blind spot -------------------------------
//
// Shadows cast by fences and foliage differ between the eyes: a piece of shadow is in one and not the
// other, in different places, and it flickers per pixel. Two things are already measured: each view
// rasterises its OWN cascade (cutting the node for the second view left that eye with no sun shadows
// at all), and the two views draw the SAME casters into it -- live, at equal resolutions, 94002 draws
// against 94004 and 267828 instances against 267831 in one interval, the residue being one frame's
// worth on the interval boundary. So the same geometry, drawn with shared cascade records, ends up as
// different pixels; and alpha-tested geometry becomes pixels through a DITHERED discard, whose noise
// slice the pixel shader picks with asuint(b0[28].y) & 63 -- a frame counter.
//
// THE FIRST PROBE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THAT. It printed fields that advance for MAIN and are frozen for
// the second view, and fields that are static but differ. A field that ADVANCES IN BOTH VIEWS WITH
// DIFFERENT VALUES falls in neither list -- and a frame counter one step apart is exactly that. So
// this reports every float whose current value differs at all, with what each side is doing to it,
// and the dither index as an integer beside it. No categories to fall between.
// DEFAULT 0: a mutex and a 120-float compare on every frame-constants upload. It found the frozen
// clock and the dither difference; neither needs watching now.
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int32_t CyberpunkVR_SwayDiff = 0;

// ---- THE GENERIC BLOCK DIFF, retargetable live --------------------------------------------------
//
// Built after the cascade shaders were read, because they showed that the block I had been holding was
// very likely the wrong INSTANCE of the right block. The cascade pixel shader dithers its alpha test
// from `asuint(b0[28].y) & 63` -- b0 being a 30-float4 block, so the 480 bytes I hold -- but the patch
// is keyed to uploads under PrepareSceneRendering. If the cascade pass uploads its own b0 under its own
// node, nothing I did ever reached it, which is exactly what "three modes, no visible change" looks
// like.
//
// And the same shader has a SECOND discard whose inputs are worse: a height-range mask addressed in a
// world grid whose origin is floor(b1[36].xyz * 21.3333) * 0.046875. The grid step is 0.046875 world
// units = 4.7 cm and the eyes are 6.5 cm apart, so 0.065 / 0.046875 = 1.39 steps: the two views land in
// DIFFERENT cells as a matter of arithmetic, not of chance, and the mask is then read at an offset in
// one eye. b1 is 53 float4 = 848 bytes.
//
// So the instrument is parameterised instead of hard-wired: point it at a (node, size) pair and it
// reports every float that differs between the views, with what each side is doing to it. Both knobs
// are live-settable, which is the difference between one build and five.

// ================================================================================================
// THE CHECKERBOARD PHASE -- why thin shadows differ between the eyes.
//
// The sun-shadow mask is evaluated at HALF resolution on a checkerboard, and the shader that does it
// (PipelineState_858, one draw per view at 1280 and 1536 -- half of 2560 and half of 3072) opens with:
//
//     x  = uint(gl_FragCoord.x);  y = uint(gl_FragCoord.y);
//     px = (x << 1) | ((asuint(cb_b6[3]).y ^ y) & 1);      // the full-res pixel this lane stands for
//
// so cb_b6[3].y decides WHICH half of the pattern this lane belongs to; the other half is reconstructed.
//
// THE PHASE IS NOT THE PROBLEM -- measured, whole-block, in gameplay: the 56-byte block is IDENTICAL for
// the two views, zero differing dwords, so both eyes use the same parity function. Forcing it patched 1008
// times and changed nothing on screen, which is what a no-op looks like. The first "the counter differs by
// one, so the parity is opposite" reading was inference, not measurement, and it was wrong.
//
// WHAT REMAINS IS THE PATTERN ITSELF, AND IT IS STRUCTURAL. `parity` is a function of the SCREEN x and y
// of the eye being drawn. One world point projects to different screen x in each eye, so it falls in the
// evaluated half in one eye and in the reconstructed half in the other; and because px = (x << 1) | parity,
// the sample it does get is a full-res pixel to the left in one eye and to the right in the other. That is
// a one-pixel horizontal disagreement, worst where a shadow is one or two pixels wide and worse with
// distance -- which is the reported symptom in the user's own words ("тени идут просто со сдвигом... чуть
// дальше тонкая часть тени в разных глазах по разному"), and why grass and cables differ while a building's
// shadow does not.
//
// NO CONSTANT CAN EQUALISE THAT. Half of the full-res pixels are never evaluated by either eye, and which
// world points land in the evaluated half is decided by each eye's own projection. Equalising the phase,
// the seed, the wind, the cascade record or the frame clock cannot change which pixels get sampled -- which
// is exactly why every one of those was measured identical and none of them helped. The only true fix is
// full-resolution evaluation, i.e. a full-width mask target and a pixel shader without the `x << 1`, and
// the engine offers no switch for it: the interleave is baked into this pass (its feature bits answer
// identically for both views, see CyberpunkVR_FeatBitProbe), "CheckerboardSize" turns out to be an editor
// selection-highlight setting, and the RTTI class that owns an "interleaved" property carries
// enabled/radius/offset/angle/events beside it and has nothing to do with shadows.
//
// So this stays a probe, at 0, and the write stays disarmed. Better a named structural limit than a knob

// apart, forcing MAIN onto the other view's fit brings that separation to exactly 0, and the sun shafts
// improved -- but they are still displaced. So the lend reaches what RASTERISES the atlas and not what
// SAMPLES it. The rasteriser's matrices come from the cascade record; the sampler's come from somewhere else,
// and only two functions in the whole exe address that record by its offset (the pass itself and
// sub_140DF150C, which is the bit-44 variant of the shadow-mask pass and is measured NOT to run -- bit 44
// answers no for both views). So the sampler reads it through a register, and the way to find that is to
// diff what the lighting node uploads rather than to keep reading disassembly.
//

// the last one compares two arbitrary different blocks. That is what produced "132 of 212 floats differ"
// with matrix rows reading M=546.40 against V=-0.0221 -- not a finding, an artefact.
//
// So this watches ONE field instead of the whole block: b1[36].xyz, which the cascade pixel shader turns
// into the height-mask grid origin as floor(x * 21.3333) * 0.046875. And it CHECKS ITS OWN ASSUMPTION --
// that the field is one value per view per frame rather than varying across those 24 blocks -- because
// mirroring it is only meaningful if it is.
// DEFAULT 0: this one locks on an 848-byte upload that happens two dozen times a frame per view.

// the blue-noise slice to a constant in every frame-constants block changed nothing). The elimination is
// sound in the other direction too -- solid objects' shadows match and only alpha-tested geometry
// differs, and alpha-tested geometry is what these discards decide.
//
// Equalising this one's input would need b1[36].xy, which I could not isolate: the cascade node uploads
// an 848-byte block two dozen times a frame and the field's spread WITHIN one view is 7-10 world units,
// so those blocks are not all the same block. Rather than guess, neutralise: the mask is a 256-texel map
// covering 12 world units around floor(b1[36].xy * 21.3333) * 0.046875, and the shader itself skips the
// test when the lookup lands outside [0,1] --

// so an origin far from the world puts every pixel out of range and the discard never fires, in either
// eye. If the shadows agree with the test dead, this discard is the cause and the real fix is to give
// both views one origin. If they still differ, nothing in this shader's discards explains it and the
// hunt moves to the cascade matrices.

// CameraShaderConsts, and two eyes ARE two cameras; forcing them equal renders both eyes from one camera and
// the picture goes flat. Copying everything is not a fix, it is deleting the second eye.
//
// But the blocks hold two different kinds of field, and only one kind is a bug:
//
//     position, orientation, view matrices        MUST differ   -- that is what stereo is
//     jitter, sequence index, clocks, counters    MUST match    -- or the eyes accumulate different results
//
// Both of today's real findings were the second kind: the frame clock that left the flags frozen, and the
// cascade fit. So instead of hunting block by block, separate the two kinds ONCE, across every block.
//
// THE DISCRIMINATOR IS A STATIONARY CAMERA. Hold still and pose-derived fields stop changing while temporal
// ones keep advancing. So this counts, per field of every block: how often it changes in each view, and how
// often the two views disagree about it. Read while standing still, a field that still advances in both views

// ---- THE VOLUMETRIC FOG'S JITTER, put in step between the eyes -----------------------------------

// Found by the wide census plus a field diff, after the cascade fit was equalised and the blocky sun shafts
// were still displaced. The fog pass uploads a 384-byte block once per view per frame, and ten of its 96
// floats differ. Most of that is legitimate:
//
//     [7].x  M=520.3243  V=520.2593   -- apart by 0.0650, i.e. exactly the IPD: the camera position
//     [7].y, [2].x, [2].y             -- differences of 1e-4, derived from it
//
// but four are not:
//
//     [10].x  M=-0.0499  V=-0.1045     the froxel jitter offset, advancing every frame
//     [10].y  M= 0.2578  V= 0.3414
//     [10].z  M= 0.4227  V=-0.1234
//     [11].z  M= 592     V= 78         the index into that jitter sequence
//
// Volumetric fog is a coarse 3D grid whose blockiness is hidden by jittering it per frame and accumulating
// over time. The two eyes jitter with different offsets and sit at different points of the sequence -- 592
// against 78 -- so they accumulate different fog. That is what the user sees as sun shafts displaced in
// opposite directions and a whole block of light present in one eye and absent in the other, and why it
// reads as the same class of artefact as the grass without being the shadow map at all.
//
// The second view runs first, so it is captured and MAIN is given its values, in-frame: taking MAIN's
// latest would hand the earlier view a sequence position from the previous frame, which is the same trap
// the cascade lend had to avoid. Copied as raw dwords, because [11].z is an integer in a float slot.
//
// AND ALL OF THAT IS RETRACTED. A later reading of the same diff printed 49 of 96 floats differing, with
// MAIN's column holding an exactly axis-aligned basis ([4] = (-1,0,0), [5] = (0,0,1), [6] = (0,-1,0)), a
// near-origin position ([7] = (0.04, 3.62, 1.59)) and round defaults ([12] = 250/250/125, [13] = 0.9/0.9/0.9)
// while the other column held a real world camera at (-7026, -4512, 80). Those are not two views of a scene.
// MAIN's column was catching a CUBEMAP FACE -- a reflection probe's fog block -- because more than one
// consumer uploads 384 bytes under this node, and the (node, size) key cannot tell them apart.
//
// So the "10 of 96 differ" reading that this fix was built on is void as well: it was comparing whichever
// instance each view happened to upload last, which is the same key-too-coarse mistake that has now cost
// this investigation five separate rounds. The fix DID fire (its counter advanced once per frame, verified)
// and it changed nothing visible -- which is the only honest thing left to say about it, because a patch
// keyed on a mixture may well have been writing scene jitter into a probe face.
//
// DEFAULT 0. Re-arming it needs a CONTENT filter, not a tighter node: the player's block is the one whose
// camera position matches the world position the player view carries, and a basis that is not axis-aligned.
// Until the probe can separate the instances, nothing measured here about per-view fog jitter is established.

// ---- THE PROJECTION JITTER, put in step between the eyes -----------------------------------------

// The once-per-frame census, after it was finally made to compare two eyes and nothing else, left four scalars
// of the 848-byte CameraShaderConsts differing while every matrix entry around them agreed to 1e-4:
//
//     [0].w   M= 0.062  V=-0.031        float 3
//     [4].z   M= 2.134  V=-1.066        float 18
//     [16].w  M= 0.062  V=-0.031        float 67
//     [28].w  M= 0.062  V=-0.031        float 115
//
// The same values appear under RenderShadowmask, VolumetricFog, ApplyTXAA, RenderBackground and
// RenderScreenSpaceWaterDepth -- i.e. it is one shared field of that block, not a per-pass quantity -- and
// they advance every frame. That is the shape of a projection JITTER: the sub-pixel offset an engine adds per
// frame so a temporal filter can accumulate. Two eyes on different jitter sequences accumulate different
// results, and the passes carrying it are exactly the ones that draw the blocky sun shafts the user reports as
// displaced in opposite directions.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. The field is not identified. The 1:-2 ratio between the views is one instant's sample,
// not a law -- a jitter sequence gives an arbitrary ratio each frame -- and an earlier reading of these same
// numbers as an eye offset was WRONG: the port's own camera measurement says the eyes sit 0.0640 m apart
// against an expected 0.0640 with no vertical disparity, so the stereo placement is correct and this is
// something else. What is established is only that these four advance and disagree while their neighbours do
// not. Equalising them is therefore a test, and its failure mode is obvious: if they are geometric rather than
// temporal, MAIN's projection visibly breaks.
//
// Captured from the second view, which runs first, and applied to MAIN in the same frame -- the same direction
// the cascade lend needed for the same reason.
//
// ANSWERED, AND THE ANSWER IS GEOMETRIC. With MAIN forced onto the other eye's values the shadows slid and
// snapped back about once a second and the MENU came up shifted by half a screen. A menu is drawn straight
// through the same projection, so a half-screen displacement says these four scalars are part of the transform
// and not a temporal offset riding on it. The failure mode was written down before the test and it is exactly
// what happened, which is the one good thing about it.
//
// So: whatever advances in them every frame, they carry geometry, and forcing them across the eyes is not
// available. DEFAULT 0, and it stays 0 -- kept only because the four field indices and their measured values
// are the record of what was ruled out.

// ---- THE CASCADE SAMPLING MATRIX: the half of the shadow setup the fit lend never reached --------
//
// Measured in RenderDoc on two independent captures, and it resolves a contradiction this file already
// records a few hundred lines down: the sun-cascade atlas is SHARED by the eyes -- one texture, written
// exactly once per frame by a single copy before either eye's pass -- and the cascade fit record is identical
// after the lend in ViewReuse.cpp ([cascrec] "differing dwords (0)", [cascfit] after=0.0000 m). By that
// reasoning the two eyes read one shadow map identically. They do not, and the dither hunt that followed from
// the same reasoning came back innocent.
//
// The missing half is the transform each eye uses to READ that shared atlas. The mask pixel shader declares
// its own constant layout, so these offsets are not guesses:
//
//     b13 CSConstants 928 B = float4 x6 | cascadeMatrix[4] | cascadeVec[4] | ... | SDistantShadowParams | ...
//
// cascadeMatrix maps an ABSOLUTE world position into the atlas -- verified by transforming the camera position
// through it and landing inside the unit cube -- so it cannot legitimately depend on which eye is looking. It
// does. Twelve of the block's 58 float4 rows differ between the eyes, the same twelve in both captures, and
// cascadeMatrix[0] and [1] are among them:
//
//     cascade 0 (12 m across, 1 texel = 5.9 mm)    lateral -5.71 / -4.83 texel    depth +58.1 mm
//     cascade 1 (40 m across, 1 texel = 19.5 mm)   lateral -8.34 / +3.39 texel    depth +58.2 mm
//
// The lateral part changes between captures because the fit is snapped to the texel grid, so what survives
// there is rounding. The depth part does not change: 58.1 / 58.2 mm in one capture, 58.1 / 58.4 in the other,
// against a geometric prediction of 58.1 mm -- the measured 0.0640 m eye separation projected onto the sun
// direction. So the cascade frame follows each eye's own camera, and each eye tests the shared atlas against
// depths biased by that projection.
//
// cascadeMatrix[2] and [3] are all zero in both captures, which is the same answer the count probe in
// ViewReuse.cpp reached from the other side: there are two cascades, and the atlas has two array slices.

// ---- ONE CASCADE CAMERA FOR BOTH VIEWS, which is where the evidence ended up pointing -------------
//
// The user's reading is what settles the direction, and it is worth more than the three lends before it:
// lending only the SAMPLING matrix reproduces the bit-50 artefact "1 в 1". Bit 50 makes a view emit no cascade
// passes at all, so it samples an atlas somebody else rasterised. Handing MAIN a foreign sampling matrix looks
// identical to that, so whatever draws the atlas is aligned with MAIN and not with the second view -- and the
// cascade record this port already equalises ([cascfit] after=0.0000 m) is therefore not what aligns it.
//
// PRECISELY WHAT DRAWS IT, from a capture taken after the fix (cpvr_frame13113): ONE pass per frame, not one
// per view. Forty depth-only DrawIndexedInstanced into the cascade target, events 23735..23879, sitting in the
// gap between the two views' graphs and immediately before MAIN's; the atlas the masks sample is not written in
// that frame at all. So the pass is single and it runs with the LAST cascade camera uploaded before it, which
// is MAIN's -- which is why MAIN's own sampling matrix used to match and the second view's did not. Lending the
// camera moves that single rasterisation onto the second view's frame, and lending the matrix puts both eyes on
// it. "A view samples the atlas it rasterised itself" was the wrong way to say this: there is only one
// rasterisation, and what matters is that the camera and the sampling matrix belong to the SAME view.
//
// What does determine it is the 848-byte CameraShaderConsts the cascade node uploads per cascade, and the
// census has been saying so all along: 848B@RenderShadowCascade M=8844 V=9782 d=18316 -- uploaded twice per
// view per frame, once per cascade, contents differing between the views. Give both views one camera there and
// the two rasterisations become the same picture, which is the only state in which either view's sampling
// matrix can be correct.
//
// Keyed by CASCADE INDEX, not by (node, size). Two cascades upload this block under one node, and pairing them
// by node and size alone would copy cascade 1's camera over cascade 0 -- guaranteed to read as "differs"
// whatever the truth is, which is the note already written against this exact census row.
//
// Whole block, per the request: cameras and matrices alike, nothing left per-view to disagree about.
//
// FAILURE MODE. This block is CameraShaderConsts, and CyberpunkVR_JitterFix above proved that forcing its

// Reopening a question I closed too early. The alpha-test dither of the cascade pass was declared innocent
// on the strength of mode 5, which forces the slice to a constant in every frame-constants block -- but
// mode 5 lives in the BUFFER uploader only, and the cascade node uploads no 480-byte block of its own, so
// which instance of b0 its pixel shader reads was never established. A test that may never have reached its
// target is not a negative result. That is the fourth time today a probe has been narrower than the thing
// it was measuring, and this time the fix is to cover both paths rather than to reason about which one.
//
// AND THE NEW MEASUREMENT MAKES IT MATTER. The depth-target probe says both eyes rasterise the sun cascades
// into the SAME atlas (casc0/casc1: identical DSV descriptors for both views), from a cascade record the
// in-frame diff shows identical. So the eyes already share one shadow map -- there is nothing to hand over,
// which answers "pass the shadows from MAIN to the second view" -- and the only way that shared map can
// still hold different content at the two lighting passes is if the two rasterisations DISAGREE about which
// alpha-tested pixels to keep. Order in a frame is: second view clears, draws, lights; then MAIN clears,
// draws, lights. Each eye samples its own rasterisation. Give them different dither slices and grass -- the
// most finely alpha-tested thing in the scene -- lands differently in the two eyes.
//
// The slices ARE different today, and by construction: [28].x/[28].y were both measured to advance in the
// two views with different values, and mode 4 hands the second view MAIN's block from the PREVIOUS frame
// (the second view runs first), so the mirroring cannot equalise them within a frame.
//
// Locking both to one constant sidesteps the ordering entirely and is the strongest form of the test. Its
// visible cost while on: the noise pattern stops animating, so alpha-tested foliage may show a fixed dither
// texture instead of a shimmer. That is a diagnostic cost, not a shipping one.
//
// RESULT, AND IT ALSO RETRACTS THE REASON FOR BUILDING IT. The counters say the constant uploader carries
// NONE of these blocks -- DitherLockBuf = 465242, DitherLockCb = 0 -- so the 480-byte frame constants travel
// the buffer path only, mode 5 had already covered every instance of them, and my "the test may never have
// reached its target" was wrong. With the slice locked on both paths the eyes still disagree on grass, so
// the cascade pass's alpha-test dither is genuinely innocent, this time on a test that provably reached
// everything.
//
// DEFAULT 0: a locked slice means static noise, which is a real visual cost for no benefit.

//
// grade_up_store is written with an SEH guard because it reads a caller-supplied pointer whose lifetime
// is the engine's business, not ours.
// ================================================================================================

// ---- colour grading: give the second eye the first eye's grading source ---------------------
//
// Symptom: the scanner's green screen tint never appeared in VRCAM, though its HUD markers did.
// The capture settles where it is lost. The tonemap pass PipelineState_777 runs for BOTH views
// with an identical set of 31 root tables and both bind the SAME `3 x Texture3D<float3>` --
// three 48^3 R11G11B10 grading tables. What differs is their CONTENT at sample time: neutral for
// VRCAM, green for MAIN. They are rebuilt once per view by CRenderNode_GenerateTonemappingLUT
// (three 6x6x6 dispatches = 48^3/8^3, recorded into the ASYNC COMPUTE list -- which is why no
// census here ever saw them until compute lists started being hooked).
//
// The node's body sub_14077A36C opens with
//     viewData = sub_1401ED930(wc);  rdi = *(viewData + 0xF88);
//     if (!rdi) goto cold;           xmm6 = *(float*)(rdi + 0x44);
//     cold:  xmm6 = flt_1431EFC58;   // = -1.0f, the "unset" sentinel
// and passes xmm6 into sub_14077B538. So MAIN feeds a real grading parameter and VRCAM feeds
// "no value", which is exactly a neutral table.
//
// `viewData+0xF88` is hole bit 8 in kViewDataHoles -- it has been in that table from the start,
// labelled "composition/debug" and left off because its consumer was unknown, and the live diff
// has reported it MAIN-set/VRCAM-zero in every sample it has ever taken.
//
// Lending is scoped to this one call and restored in a __finally, so nothing is left pointing at
// another view's object. That matters: this is the same shape of edit that crashed three times
// at viewData+0x168 -- but 0x168 is a resource SET the RTT view genuinely does not own, whereas
// this is a settings object the grading code only reads one float out of.
//
// NOT tried again: skipping the node so VRCAM reuses MAIN's tables. That turns the second eye
// black. The tables are TRANSIENT -- the capture has aliasing barriers and DiscardResource
// around them, so despite sharing a resource id there is nothing of MAIN's left to sample.
// ---- what actually differs in the composed grading parameters -------------------------------
// Measured, so no more guessing at inputs: viewData+0x640 is the SAME object for both views
// (DebugGradingSrcMain == DebugGradingSrcVrcam), and lending viewData+0xF88 fired 6776 times
// and changed nothing. So watch the OUTPUT instead. sub_14077B538 fills a 40-byte parameter
// block from that shared object plus two per-view scalars:
//     void sub_14077B538(a1, viewData, a3 /*byte*/, a4 /*float*/, a5 /*out 40B*/, a6 /*out 1B*/)
//     out[0]=src[224] out[4]=src[228] out[8]=src[232] out[16]=src[236] out[20]=src[240]
//     out[28]=a3+4    out[12]=a3 ? a4 : -1.0f        out[36..39]=src[244..247]
// Snapshot it per view and print the two side by side; whatever differs is the grade.
// ---- the constant buffers the LUT build actually reads --------------------------------------
// Everything upstream measured EQUAL between the views: same shader, same three 6x6x6 dispatches,
// same grading-settings object at viewData+0x640, and a byte-identical 40-byte parameter block
// out of sub_14077B538. Yet the tables come out neutral for VRCAM and graded for MAIN. So the
// difference has to be in what PipelineState_865 itself is handed -- its constant buffers.
//
// They live in the upload ring and are bound in place, so CopyBufferRegion never sees them; the
// place they are visible is CreateConstantBufferView, which hands over the GPU address, and the
// ring is already mapped. Capture every CBV created while GenerateTonemappingLUT is on the
