// NodeDispatch -- the one function every frame-graph node passes through, and the observers hung on it.
//
// THIS IS THE HUB. Detour_NodeDispatch is called once per node per view, and from it thirty-one other
// functions in this module get their chance to look at, count, permit, skip or redirect that node. It
// was extracted LAST on purpose: everything else had to have a home first, or this file would have
// pulled the whole module back into one place through its include list.
//
// WHAT IT DECIDES, in the order it decides it:
//
//   * which view this node belongs to -- the single comparison against the VRCAM identity hash that
//     the entire stereo path rests on
//   * whether the view's capability mask permits the node, and whether to grant a bit it lacks
//   * whether to skip the node because the other view already produced what it makes
//   * whether to record it: the per-node timing, the census, the sky and cloud snapshots
//
// THE SKIP AND THE GRANT ARE THE DANGEROUS PART, and the rule is written where they are: skipping a
// producer while leaving its feature bit SET is deliberate, because consumers below must still run and
// read what the first view produced. Clearing the bit instead makes the second eye lose the effect. That
// asymmetry is the single most expensive thing this module has learned.
//
// The offsets at the top (view-active flag, QPC timestamp, the CALLER1-only stage word) are read from
// the node's work context. They are constants because they were found by disassembly, and they are
// commented with what each holds because a bare offset is unverifiable a year later.
//
// Detour_ViewFeatureCheck sits here rather than with the frame graph: it is asked per NODE, not per
// build, and the answer it gives is what the dispatcher acts on.

// one-line function. The registrar for the one that matters here is
//     sub_1400F76B0:  "Rendering/RenderMask/DistantLights"  ->  word_143487D70
// and the test passes when the view's 32-qword mask at view+0x18A0 is a superset of the
// descriptor's words. NOTE THE +8: it compares mask[i] against desc[i+1], so the required
// words begin at descriptor+8. Reading them from descriptor+0 -- which the first grant did --
// ORs the wrong words in and the test still fails. That, not the engine, is why "granting the
// capability changed nothing".
//
// Mapping the measured refusals onto the name table settles the unlit street lamps:
//     77CED4 ClusteredLightsCull + 77D308 RenderLightBuffers  ->  RenderMask/DistantLights
//     77D214 AutoSpawnOnTerrain  + 153844 RenderShadowCascade ->  RenderMask/AutoGrass
//     1EE760 DrawHUD                                          ->  RenderMask/HUD
// and the Nsight capture agrees end to end: with DistantLights present MAIN clears the 20-byte
// argument buffer Resource_1359, fills it with a 1964-group PipelineState_597 dispatch, binds a
// 36-index unit cube and issues CommandSignature_81 -> DrawIndexedInstanced(36, 1821), i.e.
// 1821 local-light proxy volumes into the lighting target. The RTT view is refused all of it,
// so its lamps light nothing while their emissive surface still renders -- exactly the report.
//

// ---- WHICH FEATURE BITS THE SHADOW-MASK PASS ASKS ABOUT, and whether the two views answer alike -----
//
// The sun-shadow mask is the last part of the chain still unexplained: everything upstream is measured
// identical between the eyes (same casters, same cascade records, both cascades rendered by both views,
// same wind, same frame constants), and every remaining asymmetry in the small-block census is one of this
// port's own reuse knobs. Its pass, CRenderNode_RenderShadowmask, branches on feature bits --
//
//     if (feature(0x2C)) { if (feature(0x2D)) return; }      // 44 then 45: an early-out
//     if (feature(0x2C)) { ... feature(0x0E) ... }           // 44 then 14
//     ... feature(0x14), feature(0x0D) ...
//
// -- so if a bit answers differently for the two views, that eye takes a different path through the mask
// and the difference needs no exotic explanation. This measures the answers before anything is forced;
// forcing a bit whose meaning is unmeasured is what the cascade attempts cost.
//
// ANSWERED, IN GAMEPLAY, AND THE ANSWER IS NO. Every bit the pass asks about answers the same for both
// views, and the per-interval deltas are identical (408 each), so the two eyes run the pass at the same
// rate down the same branch -- the standing gap in the totals is a constant accumulated before gameplay:
//
//     bit9  M=10966/0  V=15809/0        both always YES (asked twice per pass)
//     bit44 M=0/16449  V=0/23712        both always NO  -- the early-out is never taken by either view
//     bit20 M=5483/0   V=7904/0         both always YES
//     bit13 M=5483/0   V=7904/0         both always YES
//     bit14 M=5483/0   V=7904/0         both always YES
//
// So the shadow-mask pass is not where the eyes diverge either. What is left is structural and is written
// up at CyberpunkVR_CheckerProbe in Grading.cpp: the mask is evaluated at HALF WIDTH on an interleaved
// pattern addressed in each eye's own screen space.
//
