// FrameGraph -- what the engine's frame graph decides for each view, and the RTT view it decides it for.
//
// The graph is rebuilt (fully, or incrementally) and for each view it computes a set of FEATURE BITS
// and a set of UPSCALER GROUPS. Those two sets are the whole reason the second eye can differ from the
// first while running the same code: a bit that is set for MAIN and clear for VRCAM means a pass simply
// does not run for the second view.
//
// fg_observe exists to make that difference visible. It diffs the two views' bit sets and prints what
// only one of them has -- which is how the missing passes were found, one bit at a time, rather than by
// reading a graph that has no textual form.
//
// FORCING A BIT IS NOT THE SAME AS THE PASS WORKING. A forced bit makes the producer run; whether its
// consumer has what it needs is a separate question, and the reuse code in ViewReuse.cpp is where that
// distinction is actually paid for. This file only decides what is asked for.
//
// maybe_resize_rtt and Detour_RTTViewCreate are here because the view being decided about is created
// here: the RTT component's texture is what the second eye renders into, and its dimensions have to be
// settled before any of the above means anything. Forcing ctx+0x44/0x48 to a different W/H is the note
// inside the moved block -- it records what that does and does not achieve.

// sun light that cascade/GI-reuse (mode 0) broke. mode 0 kept for A/B fallback.
//
// NOW 2, AS THE SINGLE-FACTOR TEST FOR THE FOLIAGE-SHADOW MISMATCH (2026-08-17). Mode 1 means each eye
// rasterises the sun cascades itself, into what the shared-state notes say is ONE atlas -- so the second
// view rebuilds a global that the other view also builds. Everything that FEEDS those two builds is now
// measured identical (the cascade record: 0 differing dwords in-frame; casters: 94002 draws against 94004;
// per-index dispatches: casc0/casc1 2410 each with no casc2/3 for either; wind; the whole 480-byte frame
// block, mirrored). What was never verified is the OUTPUT -- and the only way an identical-input rebuild
// can still differ is a race between one view's rebuild and the other's sampling, which lands hardest on
// alpha-tested foliage. Bit 50 removes the second rebuild entirely, so this tests exactly that and costs
// GPU time rather than spending it.
//
// Mode 2 rather than mode 0 deliberately: mode 0 is cascade reuse AND GI reuse, and the note above records
// that the pair broke interior shadows and sun light without saying which half did it. Mode 2 is cascade
// reuse alone, with GI staying native at the flag level (its reuse is a separate node-level hook,
// CyberpunkVR_GiReuseMode).
//
// TWO PREDICTED FAILURE MODES, written down so the result can be read rather than guessed at:
//   * interior shadows / sun light break in the second eye again -> then it was the cascade half of mode 0,
//     and reuse is not available at all;
//   * the second view's shadows SLIDE WITH MOVEMENT -> its graph runs first, so it would sample an atlas
//     rasterised with the PREVIOUS frame's cascade placement while using this frame's matrix. At walking
//     pace that is ~4 cm of world offset per frame.
// Either of those is a reason to go back to 1, and neither is a reason to call the test wasted.
//
// AND IT WAS THE SECOND ONE, measured: "в Main все ок, в левом глазу тени едут, артефактов много". The left
// eye is the second view, so reuse in THIS DIRECTION is structurally wrong -- not because sharing an atlas
// is wrong, but because the view that reuses runs FIRST and therefore samples content from the previous
// frame with the current frame's matrix. Back to 1.
//
// THE DIRECTION IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it is fixable: the second view runs first, so IT should be the
// builder and MAIN the reuser. Then the atlas is built and sampled inside one frame, against a record the
// in-frame probe already showed to be identical at both passes -- no staleness at all. That cannot be done
// from here (this path forces the second view's flags, not MAIN's); it belongs in the cascade node detour,
