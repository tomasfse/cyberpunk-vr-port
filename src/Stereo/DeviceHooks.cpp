// DeviceHooks -- how everything else in this module gets to run at all.
//
// The engine creates a D3D12 device, a queue, command lists and pipeline states. This file hooks the
// creation of each, so that by the time any other file here needs a command list to be watched, it
// already is.
//
// patch_command_list_vtable IS THE COUPLING THIS MODULE HAS NOT YET BROKEN. It installs TWELVE slots
// whose hooks are defined in three other files -- counted, not estimated:
//
//   CommandListCensus.cpp   7   slots 12, 13, 14, 15, 25, 44, 59  (draw, dispatch, copy, PSO, VB)
//   Dlss.cpp                3   slots 10, 21, 22                  (reset, viewport, scissor)
//   Capture.cpp             2   slots 26, 46                      (barrier, render targets)
//
// A vtable slot has no registry, so this function has to name every one of them -- precisely the
// coupling CVR_DETOUR removed for the RVA detours. A slot registry is the obvious next move; until it
// exists those hooks are declared in Stereo/StereoInternal.hpp and named here.
//
// (The mirror's appended copy is NOT in that list. It is called from Hook_ExecuteCommandLists, not
// installed into a slot, which is why it needed no declaration when the mirror moved out.)
//
// WHY THE DESCRIPTOR HEAP IS RESIZED. patch_descriptor_heap_size and Hook_CreateDescriptorHeap exist
// because the second view needs descriptors the engine did not budget for. Growing the heap at creation
// is the only place it can be done without owning the allocator.
//
// The pipeline-state hooks are not decoration either: identifying a draw by its PIXEL SHADER is what
// made the outline's blend mode findable, and pso_stream_find is how a shader is recognised inside a
// stream description whose layout the SDK does not expose.
//
// Everything here is a creation-time hook, so all of it runs before the frame loop and none of it is
// on a per-frame path. That is the reason this file can afford to log as much as it does.
