// HeadAimWeapon -- the weapon follows the head, and the shot still leaves the muzzle.
//
// Ported from dabinn's TofuExpress (d002d314 "feat(head-aim): add enhanced head aim with
// muzzle-based firing", plus the vehicle allowance from 73bdf668).
//
// The port has always had two aiming models, and the weapon-aim toggle chooses between them:
//
//   HAND AIM (toggle on, the default) -- the controller points the weapon, VRIK drives the arms,
//   and the projectile leaves the muzzle. This is unchanged.
//
//   HEAD AIM (toggle off) -- what the toggle used to mean was only "send the bullet at the camera
//   crosshair instead", which left the weapon itself wherever the animation put it: the player aimed
//   with a reticle that had no relationship to the thing in their hands. Now the WEAPON follows the
//   head: the final HMD orientation becomes WeaponRight's absolute model rotation, so what is held
//   points where the player looks, and the projectile leaves the same live muzzle as in hand aim.
//   One firing path for both modes -- which is also why the launch override no longer keys on the
//   toggle at all, only on "a weapon is out and its muzzle is published".
//
// THREE THINGS ARE DELIBERATELY LEFT TO THE GAME. Position: the vanilla pose owns where the weapon
// sits, including the ADS raise and every authored animation, so only the rotation is replaced.
// The arms: VRIK is suspended while head aim owns the weapon, because a controller-driven arm solve
// and a head-driven weapon are two different answers to the same question and the visible result is
// the arms fighting the gun. And the ADS animations, which keep playing normally.
//
// The view quaternion is already in game world axes (+Y forward), so reaching WeaponRight's model
// frame is the ordinary world-to-entity conversion and nothing more. It is taken from the LATCHED
// view packet, the same instant the rest of the solve uses.
