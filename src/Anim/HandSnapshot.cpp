// The VRIK pose path. Was include/Anim/VrikHook.hpp -- a header carrying 4,400 lines of
// implementation, included by exactly one translation unit, which is the only reason its file-scope
// objects linked at all.
//
// The shared ABI moved to Anim/VrikState.hpp. Everything below was never anybody's business but
// this file's; it was reachable only because a header cannot keep a secret.

#include "Anim/VrikHook.hpp"

// NOTE ON THE FOURTEEN DEFINITIONS BELOW THAT ARE NOT `inline`.
//
// They are declared `extern` in Anim/VrikState.hpp because the natives reach them. Leaving them
// `inline` here made MSVC treat the line as a DECLARATION matching that extern rather than a
// definition, so nothing was emitted and the link failed with twenty-two unresolved externals
// naming a file that looked correct. An extern declaration plus an inline definition is not a
// definition; plain is.


// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FILE-SCOPE OBJECTS IN THIS HEADER ARE `inline`, NOT `static`, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING.
//
// This header carries its implementation and is included by exactly one translation unit today, so
// `static` worked. It stops working the moment a second file includes it -- and splitting VRIK into
// Anim/ units is exactly that. With `static`, every including TU gets its OWN copy: the pose hook
// writes one, the solver reads another, and the failure is silent. Bone measurements come back 0,
// the hand stop never fires, a held object sits at the origin, and nothing is logged because
// nothing went wrong from the compiler's point of view.
//
// Worse for the trampoline originals (OrigWaXhUpd and its kin): a second copy is null, so the
// detour calls through a null pointer the first time that path runs.
//
// `inline` gives one object across all TUs, which is what the code has always assumed.

// Pose-apply hook on the player's live track buffer copy function. This function copies the
// evaluated pose into the destination skeleton:
//   a2[7][0] = bone transform buffer (48 bytes/bone == QsTransform:
//              Translation@+0, Rotation(x,y,z,w)@+16, Scale@+32 -- authoritative
//              from RED4ext generated QsTransform.hpp; the old comment had it
//              inverted, which is what made the floating hand misbehave)
//   a2[7][3] = track value buffer (used to identify the player)
// The buffer holds PARENT-LOCAL transforms, so a hand can't be placed by writing
// its translation directly -- VRIK_SolveArm does model-space FK + 2-bone IK and
// writes only LOCAL ROTATIONS (no translation writes => no skin stretch).
// We run AFTER the original, so writing hand bones here survives graph eval.
// THE WEAPON'S RIG. Same identification as the player's, on a different skeleton: a weapon in hand has its own
// animated component, its own pose apply through this hook, and its own track buffer. Armed from script, because
// getting the active weapon's entity is one call there and a walk through the equipment system here.
//
// The parts are read for now (g_WeaponPartHave). Writing them is the same operation the cigarette already does on
// the player's rig -- a full local T + R on a bone that carries no skin -- so a proven one; see patch notes.
// SMALL-RIG WATCH: a rig is identified by HOW MANY BONES its pass remaps -- exact and structural, where the
// census below was statistical and saturated twice. counts[a4] from the pose function gives it directly; the
// Silverhand's rig assets say 16 bones for the frame and 5 for the magazine. Characters copy hundreds, so this
// table stays small by construction.

// EVERY (bones, tracks) PAIR SEEN, so the weapon's rigs are read off a list instead of predicted. Predicting
// (16, 0) and (5, 2) from the rig assets matched nothing at all.

// THE WEAPON'S TWO RIGS, nominated by the (bones, tracks) pair the pose descriptor carries and confirmed by a
// visible write. Index 0 is the magazine rig, 1 is the frame rig. See the patch notes for the two hypotheses
// that died getting here -- a4 is a level of detail, not a rig selector, and a1[8]+0x30 is not a rig path hash.
// The bone's UNMODIFIED local translation, captured the FIRST time the hook sees this bone -- before any write,
// so it is the real rest value. The write SETS base + offset, never adds: adding accumulated without bound
// (0.123 -> 0.711 -> 3.002 m, the pistol flew out of the hands) because these bones are not in the pass's remap
// table, so nothing re-establishes them. Capturing on first sight (not "while the offset is zero") is the fix
// for a slot created with a non-zero offset: the old latch never fired for it, HaveBase stayed 0, and the write
// was skipped forever -- which is exactly why the slide test produced no movement at all.
// Rotation offset per slot, for parts that spin (rotator disc, hammer). angle in degrees about the local axis;
// 0 = no rotation write. Base quaternion is latched on first sight, like the translation base.
// Uniform SCALE write per slot (<= 0 = off). The FRAME rig carries no tracks at all (its trackNames is empty), so
// the round meshes have no showMagazine-style switch to hide them -- but the QsTransform's scale at +32 can shrink a
// bone's mesh to nothing, which is what the eject/chamber logic uses to make the extracted round vanish. The
// magazine rig DOES have tracks, and it uses them instead (see g_RigTrackSet).
// ABSOLUTE writes, for REPLAYING recorded motion. Normally a write is base + offset, which is right for driving a
// part by hand; but a path lifted out of a recording already holds the game's own local values, so it must land
// verbatim. `Abs` makes the translation absolute, `QuatOn` writes the rotation outright (the game rotates a carried
// magazine by up to 180 deg -- a translation-only drive could not follow that).
// 0 = this slot is dormant and the animation owns the bone again (see VRRigWriteOff). Any write re-arms it.
// THE PINNED SLOT, resolved ONLY on an a4==0 pass. The dst numbering is per-LOD: a low-LOD remap resolved bone 6
// to a slot whose rest read (0,40,101)mm -- not back_slider's (0,30,222) -- so writes and the base latch landed on
// a FOREIGN bone whenever the write trusted whichever pass came along ("slide dead" while applied kept counting).
// a4==0 carries the full table (measured: counts[0]=15, counts[3]=2), so its resolve is the authoritative one;
// passes that resolve differently are skipped, and passes whose remap dropped the bone write the pinned slot
// anyway -- safe, because writer 3 (RVA 0x1D2D40) restores LOCAL values after each composition, so between passes
// the slot always holds local-stage data.
// READ-BACK of every bone of the weapon rigs, as the game leaves it: parent-local translation (0..2) and rotation
// quaternion (3..6) per bone, refreshed on each pose pass BEFORE our own writes. This is the only way script can
// see what the game does to a weapon's parts -- the vrp_ slots do not ride the bones (the magazine slot is really
// the WELL), and a skinned mesh component's GetLocalToWorld is just the weapon entity's transform, identical for
// every component. Without it the recorder could not capture the native magazine motion at all.
// FLOAT TRACKS -- the GAME'S OWN visibility switch, and the right way to hide a magazine. A rig carries named float
// tracks beside its bones, and a mesh component's `visibilityAnimationParam` names the one that shows or hides it.
// The magazine rig has exactly two: `showMagazine` (index 0, what the visible mag_std mesh listens to) and
// `showMagazineReload` (1), with referenceTracks = [1, 0] -- seated magazine shown, carried one hidden. Read out of
// w_handgun__malorian_silverhand__mag_std.rig, so the index and the polarity are documented facts, not guesses. The
// frame rig's trackNames is EMPTY, which is why an ejected round still needs the scale trick above.
//
// The values live in the very buffer this hook already uses to tell one rig from another -- poseDesc[3]. Read-back
// lands in g_RigTrackVal, so script can see what the game does with them (and prove the buffer is the right one:
// with the magazine in place they must read 1 and 0). A write is g_RigTrackSet gated by g_RigTrackOn, applied every
// pass exactly like a bone write and released by clearing On.
//
// Why this beats the scale route it replaces: hiding the magazine here touches NO BONE. The scale trick had to
// register a bone write, and holding that bone every frame PINNED the game's magazine animation -- a native reload
// then ejected nothing at all (the user caught it immediately).
// RIG SIGNATURES, so a weapon is recognised from DATA instead of from code. A pass belongs to a rig when the rig's
// bone COUNT matches and the named bones sit at the expected indices -- the same test that was hard-coded for the
// Silverhand (5 bones with mag_std/mag_stdr, 16 with front_slider/back_slider/mag_slot), now a table any weapon's
// config can fill through VRRigSignature. Names arrive as strings and are hashed here with FNV1a64, which IS the
// CName hash: verified against all five of the Silverhand's hard-coded constants, exact.
//
// Slot 0 of a signature is the rig index it claims (0 = the magazine rig, 1 = the frame rig), so a weapon whose
// magazine rig has a different bone count than five simply registers its own numbers.
// 16, not 8. Signatures are per RIG, not per weapon, and two rigs can share a bone count -- so the table grows with
// every distinct rig the set covers (six by the Lexington: three frame rigs of 16/11/10 bones, the Lexington's own
// 11, the per-weapon 5-bone magazine rig and the shared one). A full table returns -1 from VRRigSignature rather
// than failing silently, which is the failure mode fixed-size tables have had four times in this project.

// 16, up from 8. Eight covered every magazine rig in the set -- they carry three tracks at most -- and it stopped
// covering them at the first REVOLVER: the Malorian Overture's speedloader has NINE, six `bulletUsed01..06` then
// `showMagazineReload`, `showMagazineReloadBullets` and `showMagazineBullets`. The one that shows the rounds in the
// cylinder is index 8, exactly one past the end, so it could be neither read nor written -- and the rounds stayed
// visible with nothing in the log to say why. `VRRigTrack` returned its -1 sentinel for 8, 9 and 10, which is what
// finally named it. Third fixed-size table in this project to run out without a word.
// Per-a4 pass telemetry for the FRAME rig (which==1): pass count, remap entry count, and where that pass's remap
// puts write slot 0's bone (-1 = dropped). Read through VRRigWriteDiag fields 20..31.
// m. Parts of the gun itself never travel a tenth of this, but an EJECTED round flies free of the weapon (the
// eject arc is a real ballistic throw), and clamping that at 0.20 chopped the flight into a stub.

// A CENSUS OF POSE PASSES. Every distinct (trackBuf, a4) the hook sees that is not the player's, with a call
// count. Recording arguments is safe in a way that walking a component's memory was not, and a4 turns out to be
// the rig selector, so the weapon's rigs show up here as entries that appear when the gun is drawn.
// 24 was not enough and it failed the way fixed tables in this project always fail: it filled with NPC rigs
// before a weapon was ever drawn and then silently accepted nothing new. The count is reported now, and
// g_PoseCensusFull says so outright.
// Was a weapon in hand when this entry was FIRST seen? That one bit removes the need for any before/after
// diffing protocol: the weapon's rigs are exactly the entries born while a weapon was out.
// Hits split by whether a weapon was in hand at the time. "Born with a weapon out" turned out to be far too weak
// a test -- seven skeletons carried the same five-mapping signature, because every NPC that spawned during the
// walk got stamped too. A weapon's rigs stop being updated the moment it is holstered, and an NPC's do not, so
// the asymmetry between these two counters is the discriminator that cannot be confused with anything.

// The write test. Added to a part bone's parent-local translation on every pass of the weapon's rig. Adding is
// idempotent per pass because the copy above re-establishes the base value from the source each time -- the same
// reason the finger replay works from this hook.

// RELOAD RECORDER FK. While on, the hook computes the whole-skeleton model-space FK from the player pass's
