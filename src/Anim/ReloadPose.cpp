// ReloadPose -- the physical reload's FINGER poses, out of the VRIK solve.

// Not VRIK. VRIK solves arms from a controller position; this replays a captured finger pose while
// the reload module has a hand on a magazine, and the two share nothing but the bone buffer they
// write into. They shared a file because the detour that reaches the buffer lives there.
//
// THE POSES ARE DELTAS, never absolute finger rotations -- that is the fact this module cost the most
// to learn. An absolute pose fights whatever the animation graph is doing that frame; a delta rides
// it. See the reload module's own notes.
//
// The GUARD stays in src/Hooks/AnimPose.cpp, verbatim, exactly as it does for the weapon rig: this
// function is entered only when the caller has already decided a reload hand is active. And it needs
// no __try of its own -- SEH is dynamic, so the detour's __except covers it across the file boundary.

// THE LEFT HAND AT REST -- RECORDED ONCE, then replayed for good.
//
// While a weapon is out the game poses the left hand as the SUPPORT half of a two-handed grip: correct for
// a flat shooter, wrong here, because in VR that hand is empty and in plain sight, wearing a claw around
// nothing. The pose that belongs there exists only as the game's own empty-handed animation, so it is
// taken from there -- but on COMMAND, not by watching.
//
// WATCHING WAS TRIED AND DOES NOT WORK, which is worth recording rather than re-attempting. The first
// version latched by itself whenever the hands were empty and every finger held within a quarter of a
// degree for a third of a second. It never fired once -- `caps == 0` across a whole session -- because an
// idle animation is never still: it breathes, and the fingers drift with it. Loosening the threshold only
// moves the failure, since a slow gesture then qualifies as rest. Motion alone cannot tell the two apart.
//
// So the moment is CHOSEN, once, with empty hands, and that frame is written to disk beside the game and
// loaded at boot. One frame of the game's own animation, kept exactly, in the units it already speaks:
// parent-local quaternions straight out of the pose buffer. Nothing is converted, so nothing can be
// converted wrongly -- which is the whole reason this is captured here rather than off a recorder take.
//
// A BASE LAYER, never an override: it is written before the reload/preview layer, so a preview still fades
// in FROM these fingers over its own blend, exactly as it faded in from the animation before.
