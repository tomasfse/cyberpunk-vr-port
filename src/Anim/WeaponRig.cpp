//
// The pose-apply detour sees two skeletons through the same function, and they are told apart by ONE
// test: whose track buffer is this. The character's buffers are g_PlayerTrackBufA/B; anything else with
// a pose descriptor is a weapon rig. The two branches are therefore mutually exclusive BY CONSTRUCTION,
// not by convention, which is what made this file separable at all.
//
// THE CONDITIONS DID NOT MOVE. All three guards stay written out in src/Hooks/AnimPose.cpp, verbatim,
// and only the bodies live here. They are not interchangeable and one of them is not even the same
// shape as the others:
//
//   rig identify + write   trackBuf is NOT either player buffer
//   census                 the same, AND g_PoseCensusOn
//   capture parts          g_WeaponRigActive AND trackBuf IS g_WeaponTrackBufA or B
//
// A cut that kept the braces balanced and moved a condition along with its body would have compiled,
// linked and run -- and a weapon-bone write that fires when it must not is a held object in the wrong
// place, not an error. So the guards were left where the engine's own control flow can be read next to
// them, and each function below is entered only when its caller has already decided it should be.
//
// SEH IS DYNAMIC, which is the fact that made this safe. The detour's __except covers everything called
// from inside its __try, including these functions in another translation unit, so none of them needs a
// __try of its own -- and MSVC would have refused to give them one alongside C++ unwinding anyway.
