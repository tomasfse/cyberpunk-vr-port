// BodyYawFollow -- PHYSICAL BODY ROTATION: the character turns under the headset, the view does not
// turn with it. Gated by "Physical body rotation" in the overlay (vrport.ini
// xr_physical_body_rotation), off by default.
//
// THE GAME TURNS THE CHARACTER; THIS ONLY ASKS IT TO. The angle goes into the engine's own per-frame
// heading delta on foot -- the channel the snap turn already uses (src/Hooks/OnFootDeltaHead.cpp) --
// so the entity yaw moves, and with it the drawn mesh, the collision, the aim and the movement
// direction, because the engine moved them itself. That is not "through input": nothing synthesises a
// mouse or a stick; it is the same heading accumulator the snap turn writes.
//
// TWO ROUTES WERE TRIED FIRST AND BOTH FAILED. They are recorded because each looked obviously right:
//
//   1. state+0x1D0 at the store site sub_140336390. The only write to that field in the whole
//      function, so it looked like the source -- and it is a copy nothing propagates: with -45 deg
//      sitting in it, the game's own body heading stayed at the engine yaw to five digits.
//   2. The components' world rotations, pre-multiplied by Rz(offset) from PatchCamera's stub on
//      UpdateWorldTransforms. This one DID reach the transforms -- measured with a live scan: all 102
//      of the player's transform records carried our angle, and the body visibly turned.
//
//      IT WAS REJECTED FOR THE WRONG REASON, and the correction belongs here because the wrong reason
//      was recorded as measured. The hands rode along, and that was blamed on the transform route --
//      but the cause was a mismatch in LocateCamera that this route did not create and does not
//      depend on: the published view orientation is composed from `bodyGameForward`, which is the
//      camera component's pre-write quaternion, and the camera INHERITS its yaw from the parent
//      component this route rotates. So the published view carried E+offset while the camera we
//      composed (from the census value) carried E, and the hand offset from the head came out rotated
//      by the whole offset. The heading route had the same defect with the signs swapped -- published
//      E, drawn E-realign -- and fixing it once at the source fixed the hands in both.
//
//      What DOES rule this route out is the gameplay half, which no frame fix reaches: the engine
//      derives aim, movement direction, cover and the collision capsule from its own heading, not from
//      these transforms, so the body turns in the picture while the character still shoots and walks
//      the old way. Second, we do not own the set: 102 records plus the components, of which 2 pass
//      our hook per frame (measured 144/s at 72 fps), and whether the one the skinning uses is among
//      them -- and whether the engine recomputes it after our write -- is a race with its own pass
//      order, not an invariant. It remains the right route for a PURELY VISUAL body turn.
//
// WHERE THE CANCELLATION LIVES, AND WHY NOT IN THE RECENTER BASE. The heading also feeds the camera,
// so injecting into it would swing the view. The old on-foot code cancelled that with
// RotateBaseYaw(step): the frame loop reports the head relative to that base both ways --
//     relPos = RotateVector(conj(base.ori), headPos - base.pos)
//     relOri = conj(base.ori) * headOri
// -- so the head's orientation and its room position each lose what the heading gained, and the view,
// the play space and the head-local hand poses all stay put. Correct in the algebra, wrong in the
// ORDER: the heading changes inside the game tick while the base only takes effect on the next XR
// cycle, so for one frame the view swings by the whole step. That is the camera drift this feature
// was always reported to have.
//
// So the base is left alone -- recentring keeps working exactly as before -- and the cancellation is
// done on our side, in the same frame, where the view is composed:
//
//     body   yaw = E            (engine's own, ours included: E = E0 + realign)
//     view   yaw = E - realign  (PatchCamera, LocateCamera's head-offset recipe)
//     solve  yaw = E            (world->model in the pose path)
//
// The view is then exactly what it would have been had the body never turned, the play space is
// anchored to the heading that existed at recenter, and the hands need no compensation of their own:
// their poses are head-local against an untouched base, and the solve converting with the body's TRUE
// yaw puts the model-space target back at the controller. That last point is also self-correcting --
// the solve reads the yaw the engine actually ended up at (from the census), so a heading the engine
// clamps or eases still leaves the hands on the controllers.
