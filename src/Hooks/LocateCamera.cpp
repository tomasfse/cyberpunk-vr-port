// reads its clean base from g_engineCamQuat -- the quaternion PatchCamera snapshotted

// the documented way to make the camera spin up without bound from the smallest head turn:
// our write feeds our next base, and the loop has no fixed point.

// INSTALL ORDER IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS: Locate 10, Patch 12, Final 14, all in Stage::Boot. An
// adversarial pass over the plan for this split proposed reordering Patch before Locate for a
// "single-meaning" startup signal, and the payoff does not exist: g_engineCamQuatValid is set only
// when camKind == 1, which needs ClassifyPatchCameraOwner to have self-calibrated its name offset,
// which cannot happen until MAIN's placed component passes the site. The fallback stays an ordinary
// startup transient in BOTH orders. The two windows being weighed are the gap between consecutive
// FindPattern calls inside one function -- microseconds. An unobservable change is not a safe
// change; it is an unfalsifiable one, so the order is preserved.

//
// Ported from dabinn's TofuExpress (4f676e33). CP2077 renders the world and the first-person
// weapon/body layer with INDEPENDENT ADS zooms. On a flat screen that is invisible, because the
// sight is held at the centre of the screen where both projections agree. In VR the sight is held
// off-axis in front of one eye, and two magnifications put it in two different screen positions --
// which is the reticle and scope glass drifting away from where the bullet actually goes.
//
// The fix drives the WEAPON override from MAIN's live world magnification while aiming, and restores
// the engine's own pair on the way out. MAIN/world projection is left completely alone: it is the
// reference, not the thing being corrected.
//
// NO __try/__except, which is where this departs from the original. This project has measured that
// __try does NOT protect a bad access in Cyberpunk -- REDEngine's vectored handler takes the
// exception before the frame-based handler is ever consulted -- so the guard is the one that works
// here: probed reads and writes, plus a plausibility gate. The gate matters twice over because these
// two offsets were found on someone else's build: a weight that is not in [0,1] or a zoom that is
// not a positive finite number means the field is not the field, and the honest response is to leave
// the engine alone and say so once, rather than to write a float into whatever is really there.

// ---- WHICH VIEW IS RECORDING RIGHT NOW ---------------------------------------------------
// The exact answer, and the only one that survives MAIN and VRCAM being the same size.
//
// The render graph's node dispatcher carries the view context in work_context+0x18, and the
// view's identity is the CName hash at ctx+0x28: MAIN is 0, VRCAM is the hash of its feed
// name, and the engine's own helper views (distant geometry, shadows, reflections) each have
// their own. Nodes record their command lists on the dispatching thread, so a thread-local
// set here is readable from the D3D12 hooks that run inside the node -- which is exactly how
// the depth pick below can know whose depth-stencil it is looking at, instead of guessing
// from resolution.
//
// One hook, not the whole stereo module: this is the single fact needed.
