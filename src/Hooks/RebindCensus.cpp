// RebindCensus -- how many times per frame the engine re-establishes world transforms from their
// bindings, and nothing else.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `sub_1401D9528` is the loop that walks a component's bindings, asks each provider
// for its slot transform ([vt+0xD8] -> sub_1401D92A0, which is simply parent+0xE0/+0xF0) and calls
// SetWorldTransform for it -- which lands in sub_1401D8558, the very function our camera write
// detours. Everything the camera inherits, heading included, arrives through this loop; the camera
// itself owns no yaw (its local quaternion is never written -- checked live with a write watchpoint
// that never fired).
//
// So the question this census answers is exactly one: does that loop run ONCE per rendered frame, or
// more than once? Twice would mean the skeleton is placed with two different world transforms inside
// one image, which is what a body double on a fast mouse turn looks like -- with the world itself
// unaffected, independent of VRIK, of VRCAM and of temporal upscaling. That is the reported symptom,
// and no counter we had could tell the two cases apart.
//
// The precedent for reading it this way is the HUD node: its census (150/s against 74 presents) is
// what let us RULE the HUD out, because the code already documented that DrawHUD enters twice by
// design. A rate is the cheapest instrument that can settle a "how many times" question, so measure
// before touching anything.
//
// Cost: one atomic increment on a call the engine already makes. No allocation, no logging on the
// hot path -- the rate is printed by the census in OpenXRPresent, once every couple of seconds.
